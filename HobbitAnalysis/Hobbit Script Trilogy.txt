The Hobbit


[The scene starts off black.]

[Bilbo:] “My dear Frodo.”

[Bilbo lights a match, then uses it to light a candle. He walks through a hallway in Bag End, carrying the candle.]

[Bilbo:] “You asked me one once if I had told you everything there was to know about my adventures. And while I can honestly say I have told you the truth, I may not have told you all of it.”

[Bilbo opens a chest. He glances with fascination and recollection at Sting, his sword in its sheath, and reaches out to touch it. At the last second, he hurriedly restrains himself and pulls out a large red book from the chest instead. Sitting down at his desk and opening the book, he sees a drawing of his younger self. He picks up the picture and gazes at it.]

[Bilbo:] “I am old now, Frodo. I’m not the same Hobbit I once was.”

[Bilbo dips his quill in a pot of ink, and poises to write in the book. He begins writing.]

[Bilbo:] “I think it is time for you to know what really happened. It began long ago in a land far away to the east, the like of which you will not find in the world today.”

[The camera fades away from Bilbo in his study and begins panning over a map of Middle-earth. We see a city, Dale, full of humans and dwarves walking happily through markets and bazaars.]

[Bilbo:] “There was the city of Dale. Its markets known far and wide, full of the bounties of vine and vale. Peaceful, and prosperous. For this city lay before the doors of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth: Erebor. Stronghold of Thror, King under the Mountain, mightiest of the dwarf lords.” 

[The camera swoops over the city of Dale and reveals an enormous mountain just behind the city; a massive gateway has been built into the side of the mountain, flanked by humongous stone statues of dwarfs. We see Thror and his son Thrain inside the castle, looking out of the battlements and observing their domains. The camera pans through the city of Erebor, seeing vast chambers and massive, carved statues. Thror sits on his throne as his son, Thrain approaches him; his grandson, Thorin, stands at his right side.]

[Bilbo:] “Thror ruled with utter surety, never doubting his house would endure, for his line lay secure in the lives of his son and grandson. Ahhh, Frodo, Erebor; built deep within the mountain itself, the beauty of this fortress city was legend.”

[The camera pans over the vast gold quarries within Erebor; dwarves with magnifying lenses sift through piles of rare jewels; smiths pound metal with mallets. A dwarf quarrying for gold sees a glow in the rock; he peels away the rock and finds a beautiful, glowing gem, the Arkenstone.]

[Bilbo:] “Its wealth lay in the earth, in precious gems hewed from rock, and in great seams of gold, running like rivers through stone. The skill of the dwarves was unequaled, fashioning objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. Ever they delved deeper, down into the dark. And that is where they found it. The heart of the mountain. The Arkenstone. Thror named it the King’s Jewel. He took it as a sign, a sign that his his right to rule was divine. All would pay homage to him, even the great Elvenking, Thranduil.”

[The Arkenstone has been placed in a special pedestal on Thror’s throne; as he sits on his throne, flanked by his son, grandson, and other officers, Thranduil and his aides approach.]

[Bilbo:] “But the years of peace and plenty were not to last. Slowly, the days turned sour, and the watchful nights closed in. Thror’s love of gold had grown too fierce. A sickness had begun to grow within him; it was a sickness of the mind. And where sickness thrives, bad things will follow.”

[A shadow begins to cover the massive gates of Erebor. Thror walks through his massive rooms full of treasure, looking consumed with greed. Thorin watches him from a distance, then slowly retreats into a shadow.]



[Some time later, a paper dragon kite is being flown over Dale, along with other childrens’ kites. Suddenly, a great wind comes, blowing the trees on the mountainside until the bend and creak. Thorin and Balin, a fellow dwarf, rush to the battlements and look for any sign of danger.]

[Bilbo:] “The first they heard was a noise like a hurricane coming down from the north. The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked in a hot, dry wind.”

[Thorin:] “Balin, sound the alarm. Call out the guard. Do it now!”

[Balin:] “What is it?”

[Thorin, looking worried, yells to everyone in the halls.]

[Thorin:] “Dragon. Dragon!!!”

[A roar sounds, and torrents of fire rain all over Erebor; Thorin pulls Balin behind a pillar just in time to save him from being burned.]

[Bilbo:] “It was a fire drake from the north. Smaug had come.”

[The kites from earlier are suddenly burned away. The people in the town of Dale scream in fear and panic as Smaug destroys their city, setting fire to many buildings and demolishing others. We only see slight glimpses of Smaug as he swoops about, breathing fire and destroying buildings by smashing into them. A little girl cries as she watches her doll burn in the street.]

[Bilbo:] “Such wanton death was dealt that day, for this city of men was nothing to Smaug; his eye was set on another prize. For dragons covet gold, with a dark and fierce desire.”

[Thorin and Thror, along with many other Dwarf soldiers, wait with weapons ready behind the gates of Erebor.]

[Thorin:] “Stand firm!”

[Fire bursts through cracks in the gates as Smaug tries to smash his way in. Smaug soon breaks through the gate of Erebor and starts killing dwarves left and right, trampling them and burning them. Thorin is nearly stepped on by the dragon, but he escapes. Thror fearfully runs to his throne and detaches the Arkenstone, running away with it. As he runs through a doorway, he sees Smaug in front of him; tripping, he drops the Arkenstone, and it rolls into a massive pile of gold.]

[Thror:] “No!”

[Thorin appears and drags him away.]

[Bilbo:] “Erebor was lost, for a dragon will guard his plunder as long as he lives.”

[As the dwarves run away from Erebor, they see King Thranduil and his elves approaching the mountain. Thorin and the others scream to the Elves to help them, but Thranduil, astride his deer, turns away.]

[Thorin:] “Run for your lives! Help us!”

[Bilbo:] “Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon. No help came from the elves that day, or any day since.”

[Thorin glares in anger at the retreating elves. The remnants of the Dwarf kingdom slowly journey across vast, swampy lands. Thorin, at the front, stands on a mountaintop as his people come to him.]

[Bilbo:] “Robbed of their homeland, the dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness, a once mighty people brought low.”
 
[Thorin works in a city of men as a smith; he pounds a sword with his mallet with increasing ferocity and anger]

[Bilbo:] “The young dwarf prince took work where he could find it, laboring in the villages of men, but always he remembered the mountain smoke beneath the moon, the trees like torches blazing bright, for he had seen dragon fire in the sky, and his city turned to ash, and never forgave, and he never forgot.”



[The scene fades to Bag End in Hobbiton, where we met Bilbo earlier. Bilbo is in his study, writing in his book.]

[Bilbo:] “That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in. For quite by chance, and the will of a Wizard, fate decided I would become part of this tale. It began, well, it began as you might expect. In a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, full of worms and oozy smells; this was a Hobbit-hole, and that means good food, a warm hearth, and all the comforts of home.”

[Frodo, eating an apple, walks out of Bag End and picks up the mail from the mailbox. He returns inside and gives the mail to Bilbo. Bilbo, who was laughing while writing in his book, quickly quiets down as Frodo approaches him.]

[Bilbo:] “Thank you.”

[Frodo picks up the picture of a young Bilbo.]

[Frodo:] “What’s this?”

[Bilbo grabs back the picture.]

[Bilbo:] “That is private. Keep your sticky paws off. It’s not ready yet.”

[Frodo:] “Not ready for what?”

[Bilbo:] “Reading.”

[Frodo picks up and examines some old object of Bilbo’s. Bilbo examines the pile of letters]

[Bilbo:] “What on earth are these?”

[Frodo:] “Replies to the party invitations.”

[Bilbo:] “Oh! Good gracious! Is it today?”

[Frodo:] “They all said they’re coming. Except for the Sackville-Bagginses; they’re demanding you ask them in person.”

[Bilbo:] “Are they, indeed? Over my dead body.”

[Frodo:] “They’d probably find that quite agreeable! They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.”

[Bilbo:] “It was one small chest, hardly overflowing. And it still smells of troll.”

[Bilbo starts hiding his valuables in chests, jars, vases, and other inconspicuous places.]

[Frodo:] “What on earth are you doing?”

[Bilbo:] “Taking precautions. You know, I caught her making off with the silverware once.”

[Frodo:] “Who?”

[Bilbo:] “Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. She had all my spoons stuffed in her pockets. Hah! Dreadful woman; make sure you keep an eye on her after I’m ... when I’m ...  when I’m...”

[Frodo:] “When you’re...what?”

[Bilbo:] “It’s nothing. Nothing.”



[Bilbo looks at some papers on a table.]

[Frodo:] “You know, some people are beginning to wonder about you, Uncle. They think you’re becoming odd.”

[Bilbo:] “Odd? Hmm.”

[Frodo:] “Unsociable.”

[Bilbo:] “Unsociable? Me? Nonsense. Be a good lad and put that on the gate.”

[Bilbo hands Frodo a sign he’s made; Frodo looks at it dubiously.]



[Going outside, Frodo nails the sign to the gate of Bag End. It says “NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS.” Bilbo comes outside and stretches.]

[Frodo:] “You think he’ll come?”

[Bilbo:] “Who?”

[Frodo:] “Gandalf.”

[Bilbo:] “Ahhh. He wouldn’t miss a chance to lit up his whiz-poppers! He’ll give us quite a show, you’ll see.”

[Frodo:] “Alright then, I’m off.”

[Bilbo:] “Off to where?”

[Frodo:] “East Farthing woods. I’m going to surprise him.”

[Bilbo:] “Well, go on then! You don’t want to be late.”

[As Frodo runs off, the camera pans over the Shire. Bilbo sits on a bench outside his door, smoking his pipe; he blows out a large smoke ring which floats into the sky.]

[Bilbo:] “He doesn’t approve of being late. Not that I ever was. In those days, I was always on time. I was entirely respectable. And nothing unexpected ever happened.”



AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY
60 years earlier...

[Bilbo’s smoke ring collapses and becomes a smoke moth, as a tall figure walks into the shot. The moth flies into Bilbo’s face, waking him from his reverie. A younger Bilbo, from 60 years earlier, is sitting on the same bench, smoking his pipe. He looks up in surprise and sees a hooded figure.]

[Bilbo:] “Good morning.”



[Gandalf:] “What do you mean? Do you mean to wish me a good morning, or do you mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not? Or, perhaps you mean to say that you feel good on this particular morning. Or are you simply stating that this is a morning to be good on?”

[Bilbo:] “All of them at once, I suppose.”

[Gandalf looks slightly disapprovingly at Bilbo; Bilbo is confused and bewildered.]

[Bilbo:] “Can I help you?”

[Gandalf:] “That remains to be seen. I’m looking for someone to share in an adventure.”

[Bilbo:] “An adventure? Now, I don’t imagine anyone west of Bree would have much interest in adventures. Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things. Make you late for dinner, hm, mm”

[Bilbo gets up and checks his mailbox, grabbing some mail and sorting through it, clucking to himself. He looks quite uncomfortable because Gandalf is still standing there. Puffing his pipe in vexation, he begins heading back inside.]

[Bilbo:] “Good morning.”

[Gandalf:] “To think that I should have lived to be good-morninged by Belladonna Took’s son, as if I were selling buttons at the door.”

[Bilbo:] “Beg your pardon?”

[Gandalf:] “You’ve changed, and not entirely for the better, Bilbo Baggins.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m sorry, do I know you?”

[Gandalf:] “Well, you know my name, although you don’t remember I belong to it. I’m Gandalf! And Gandalf means … me.”

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf...not Gandalf, the wandering Wizard, who made such excellent fireworks! Old Took used to have them on Midsummer’s Eve. Ha, ha! Well. Hmm, I had no idea you were still in business.”

[Gandalf:] “And where else should I be?”

[Bilbo:] “Ha, ha! Hm, hmm...”

[Bilbo puffs confusedly on his pipe]

[Gandalf:] “Well, I’m pleased to find your remember something about me, even if it’s only my fireworks. Well that’s decided. It will be very good for you, and most amusing for me. I shall inform the others.”

[Bilbo:] “Inform the who? What? No. No. No! Wait. We do not want any adventures here, thank you. Not today, not-mm. I suggest you try over the Hill or across the Water. Good morning.”

[Bilbo, in frustration, retreats into Bag End, gesturing at Gandalf with his pipe. Once inside, he bolts the door and leans against it. Hearing a curious noise, he puts his ear close to the door. The noise is from Gandalf drawing a glowing symbol on Bilbo’s door with his staff. Alarmed, Bilbo looks out his side window, only to find Gandalf’s eye appear in front of him. He jumps back in fright and hides behind a wall; he looks out another window and sees Gandalf hurrying away.]





[It is nighttime. In Bag End, Bilbo prepares a dinner of fish; he settles down at his table, tucks a napkin in his collar, and begins sprinkling salt on his fish. Unbeknownst to him, the the symbol on the door glows, and the shadow of a person appears on the door. Bilbo, in the middle of squeezing lemon juice on his fish, looks up in surprise as the doorbell rings. He opens the door and finds a tall, bald dwarf on his doorstep. The dwarf greets him and bows slightly.]

[Bilbo:] “Ah.”

[Dwalin:] “Dwalin, at your service.”  

[Shellshocked, Bilbo lets out a noise like a whimper. Coming to his senses, he quickly ties his robe tighter and stands taller, although he is still confused.]

[Bilbo:] “Bilbo Baggins, at yours.” 

[Dwalin walks inside without an invitation]

[Bilbo:] “D-do we know each other?”

[Dwalin:] “No. Which way, laddie? Is it down here?”

[Bilbo:] “I-is what down where?”

[Dwalin dumps some of his stuff on the ground and thrusts the rest onto Bilbo.]

[Dwalin:] “Supper. He said there’d be food, and lots of it.”
 
[Bilbo:] “H-He said? Who said?”

[Dwalin sits at Bilbo’s spot on the kitchen table, eating Bilbo’s dinner, while Bilbo sits behind him, confused. Dwalin eats all the flesh from the fish, then eats the head as well, as Bilbo looks on in disgust.]



[Dwalin:] “Mmmm. … Very good, this. Any more?”

[Bilbo:] “What? Uh, oh, yes, yes

[Dwalin:] “Ah.”

[Bilbo:] “Help yourself.”

[Bilbo brings over a plate of biscuits; he hurriedly hides one behind his back for himself. Dwalin begins stuffing them in his mouth.]

[Bilbo:] “Mmmm. It’s just that, um, I wasn’t expecting company.”

[The bell rings again, and Bilbo looks up in alarm.]

[Dwalin:] “That’ll be the door.”

[Bilbo opens the door and finds an old, white-haired dwarf waiting and bowing.]

[Balin:] “Balin, at your service.”

[Bilbo:] “Good evening.”

[Balin:] “Yes, yes it is, though I think it might rain later. Am I late?”

[Bilbo:] “Late for what?”

[Balin sees Dwalin, who is trying to get more biscuits from Bilbo’s jar.]

[Balin:] “Oh, ha ha! Evening, brother. Heh, heh.”

[Dwalin:] “Oh, by my beard, you are shorter and wider than last we met.’

[Balin:] “Wider, not shorter. Sharp enough for both of us.”

[Laughing, they greet each other amicably. Putting their arms on each other’s shoulders, they smash their foreheads together. Bilbo looks on in wonder.]

[Bilbo:] “Uh, excuse me; sorry, I hate to interrupt, ah, but the thing is, I’m not entirely sure you’re in the right house.”



[Ignoring Bilbo, Dwalin and Balin have gone into Bilbo’s pantry, where they are pouring ale and examining the food. As they talk to each other, Bilbo continues his speech.]

[Dwalin:] “Have you eaten?

[Bilbo:] “It’s not that I don’t like visitors; I-I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit, but I do like to know them before they come visiting.”

[Dwalin and Balin, not listening to Bilbo, are still rifling through his pantry. ]

[Balin:] “Ah, that looks very nice indeed.”

[Dwalin:] [indistinguishable] 

[Balin picks up a lump of cheese.]

[Dwalin:] “What’s this?”

[Balin:] “I don’t know, [indistinguishable] cheese.” 

[Bilbo:] “The thing is, um--”

[Balin:] “It’s gone blue.”

[Dwalin:] “It’s riddled with mold.”

[Dwalin takes the cheese and tosses it out of the pantry, past the still-speaking Bilbo.]

[Bilbo:] “The thing is, um, I, I don’t know either of you, not in the slightest. I don’t mean to be blunt, but I uh, but I had to speak my mind. I’m sorry.”

[Balin:] [indistinguishable] 

[The two dwarves pause and look at Bilbo.]

[Balin:] “Hm. Apology accepted. 

[Bilbo:] “Mm!”

[Balin:] “Ah, now fill it up, brother, don’t stint. I could eat again, if you insist.”
 
[Balin hands a tankard to Dwalin so that it can be filled with ale. In the background, the doorbell rings again.]

	


[Bilbo opens it to find two young dwarves. Upon seeing them, Bilbo makes a small noise which sounds like a moan.]



[Fili:] “Fili.”

[Kili:] “And Kili.”

[Fili and Kili, together:] “At your service.”

[Kili:] “You must be Mr. Boggins.”

[Bilbo:] “Nope, you can’t come in, you’ve come to the wrong house.”

[Bilbo tries closing the door, but Kili stops it with his foot.]

[Kili:] “What? Has it been cancelled?”

[Fili:] “No one told us.”

[Bilbo:] “Can--? No--nothing’s been cancelled.”

[Kili:] “Well, that’s a relief.”

[The dwarves push their way in and begin unloading their stuff onto Bilbo.] 

[Fili:] “Careful with these, I just had ‘em sharpened.”

[Kili:] “It’s nice, this place. D’you you do it yourself?”

[Kili scrapes the mud off his boots on the edge of a chest standing nearby.]


[Bilbo:] “Ah, no, it’s been in the family for years. That’s my mother’s glory box, can you please not do that?!”

[Dwalin:] “Fili, Kili, come on, give us a hand.”

[Kili:] “Mister Dwalin.”

[The dwarves laugh.] 

[Balin:] “Let’s shove this in the hallway, otherwise we’ll never get everyone in.”

[The dwarves prepare to shift Bilbo’s furniture around to create a meeting/feasting place.]

[Bilbo:] “Ev--everyone? How many more are there?”

[Fili or Kili:] “Where do you want this?” 

[The doorbell rings very hard and longer than before. Bilbo, in anger, walks quickly toward the door, dumping all the swords and other equipment in his arms along the way.]

[Bilbo:] “Oh no. No, no! There’s nobody home. Go away, and bother somebody else. There’s far too many dwarves in my dining room as it is. If- if- If this is some clotterd’s idea of a joke, ha ha, I can only say, it is in very poor taste.” 

[Bilbo opens the door, and an entire heap of dwarves, eight to be exact, fall in. Struggling to get up, they grumble and yell at each other, saying “Get off!”. Gandalf is standing behind them.]

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf.”

[The entire group of dwarves, 12 of them, begins raiding Bilbo’s pantry and taking out all his food. He tries to tell them to put it back, but they ignore him.]

[Bilbo:] “Those are my plates! Excuse me! Not my wine. Put that back. Put that back! Not the jam, please! ...Excuse me.”

[Bombur walks out of the pantry with three entire wheels of cheese.]

[Bilbo:] “Excuse me. A tad excessive, isn’t it? Have you got a cheese knife?”

[Bofur:] “Cheese knife? He eats it by the block.”

[Oin and Gloin walk through the hall carrying chairs from one of Bilbo’s rooms.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, that’s Grandpa Mungo's chair! No, I’m sorry, you’ll have to take it back please. Take it back...It’s antique, not for sitting on! Thank you! That’s a book, not a coaster. Put that map down, thank you.”

[Oin:] “I cannot hear what you’re saying!”

[The dwarves continue bringing all of Bilbo’s food and furniture into the dining room. Dori approaches Gandalf with a tray and some tea.]

[Dori:] “Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf, can I tempt you with a nice cup of chamomile tea?”

[Gandalf:] “Oh, no thank you, Dori. A little red wine for me, I think.”

[Gandalf walks out of the dining room, trying to avoid the scurrying dwarves. He hits his head on the chandelier, then he begins counting the dwarves on his fingers.]

[Gandalf:] “Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori...Ori.”

[Bilbo wrestles a bowl of tomatoes away from Nori. Bifur, the dwarf with an axe in his head, approaches Gandalf and talks to him in Khuzdul (untranslated) and with body motions.]

[Gandalf:] “Yes, you’re quite right, Bifur. We appear to be one dwarf short.”

[Dwalin:] “He is late, is all. He travelled North to a meeting of our kin. He will come.”

[Dori:] “Mr. Gandalf? 

[Gandalf:] “Hmmm?”

[Dori:]  “A little glass of red wine, as requested. It’s, eh, got a fruity bouquet.”

[Gandalf:] “Ah, Cheers.”

[Gandalf drinks the tiny cup of wine Dori offers him, then looks sadly at the cup, wanting a little more.]

[Gandalf:] “Mm.”

[The dwarves, sitting in Bilbo’s dining room, have a grand feast with all his food. They are quite rude and messy about it. Bofur throws some food to his brother, Bombur.]

[Bofur:] “Bombur, catch!”

[Bombur catches the food in his mouth, and everyone cheers. As everyone begins throwing food around, Bilbo walks away in disgust. He looks at his pantry in shock; it has been entirely cleared of food. Fili walks on top of the table, carrying several cups of ale and knocking aside the food in his way.]

[Fili:] “Who wants an ale? There you go.”

[Dwalin:] “Let him have another drink!”

[Fili:] “Here you go.”

[Dwalin pours his ale into Oin’s hearing trumpet, and as Oin splutters in anger, everyone else laughs. Oin puts his hearing trumpet to his mouth and blows the ale out of it, making it squeal. One of the dwarves yells, “On the count of three!” and the dwarves pound their tankards together. Someone counts, “One!...Two!” Then all the dwarves go quiet and begin drinking their ale together. They are incredibly messy, as ale falls all over their faces and runs down their beards. When finished drinking, they begin burping; the youngest, Ori, lets out the biggest burp. The dwarves laugh. Bilbo looks away in disgust.]



[When the meal finishes, the dwarves leave the table and begin walking about. Bilbo grabs a doily back from Nori.]

[Bilbo:] “Excuse me, that is a doily, not a dishcloth!”

[Bofur:] “But it’s full of holes!”

[Bilbo:] “It’s supposed to look like that, it’s crochet.”

[Bofur:] “Oh, and a wonderful game it is too, if you got the balls for it.”

[Bilbo:] “Bebother and confusticate these dwarves!”

[Gandalf:] “My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?”

[Bilbo:] “What’s the matter? I’m surrounded by dwarves. What are they doing here?”

[Gandalf:] “Oh, they’re quite a merry gathering, once you get used to them.”

[Nori has a chain of sausages over his shoulder, and Bofur grabs them from him. They play tug-of-war with the sausages.]

[Bilbo:] “I don’t want to get used to them. The state of my kitchen! There’s mud trod into the carpet, they’ve pi-pillaged the pantry. I’m not even going to tell you what they’ve done in the bathroom; they’ve all but destroyed the plumbing. I don’t understand what they’re doing in my house!”

[Ori:] “Excuse me. I’m sorry to interrupt, but what should I do with my plate?”

[Fili:] “Here you go, Ori, give it to me.”

[Fili takes the plate from Ori and throws it to Kili, who throws it behind his back to Bifur, who is standing at the sink in the kitchen. Bifur catches it behind his back, without even looking at it. Kili, Fili, and other dwarves begin throwing the plates, bowls, and utensils to each other, eventually throwing them to the sink to be washed. As dishware flies through the air, Gandalf ducks to avoid getting hit.]

[Gandalf:] “Oh!”

[Bilbo:] “Excuse me, that’s my mother’s West Farthing crockery, it’s over a hundred years old!”

[The dwarves at the tablet begin rhythmically drumming on the tablet with utensils and their fists.]

[Bilbo:] “And can-can you not do that? You’ll blunt them!”

[Bofur:] “Ooh, d’hear that, lads? He says we’ll blunt the knives.”

[Kili begins singing and the other dwarves join him, as they continue throwing the dishware]

[The dwarves, singing:]
“Blunt the knives, bend the forks
Smash the bottles and burn the corks
Chip the glasses and crack the plates
That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates!
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat
Pour the milk on the pantry floor
Splash the wine on every door
Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl
Pound them up with a thumping pole
When you’ve finished, if any are whole
Send them down the hall to roll
...
That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates!”



[Bilbo huffs up in anger, only to find all the dishes stacked neatly and cleanly. The dwarves and Gandalf laugh. Suddenly, there are three loud knocks on the door, and everyone falls silent.]

[Gandalf:] “He is here.”

[They open the door, and there stands Thorin. He enters Bag End.]

[Thorin:] “Gandalf. I thought you said this place would be easy to find. I lost my way, twice. Wouldn’t have found it at all had it not been for that mark on the door.”

[Bilbo:] “Mark? There’s no mark on that door. It was painted a week ago!”

[Gandalf:] “There is a mark; I put it there myself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce the leader of our company, Thorin Oakenshield.”

[Thorin:] “So, this is the Hobbit. Tell me, Mr. Baggins, have you done much fighting?”

[Bilbo:] “Pardon me?”

[Thorin:] “Axe or sword? What’s your weapon of choice?”

[Bilbo:] “Well, I have some skill at Conkers, if you must know, but I fail to see why that’s relevant.”

[Thorin:] “Thought as much. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.”

[The dwarves all laugh, and they walk back to the dining table. As Thorin eats, the rest of them talk to him.]

[Balin:] “What news from the meeting in Ered Luin? Did they all come?”

[Thorin:] “Aye. Envoys from all seven kingdoms.”

[The dwarves murmur their joy.]

[Dwalin:] “What do the dwarves of the Iron Hills say? Is Dain with us?”

[Thorin:] “They will not come.] 

[The dwarves murmur in disappointment.]



[Thorin:] “They say this quest is ours, and ours alone.”

[Further disappointed murmurs.] 

[Bilbo:] “You’re going on a quest?”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo, my dear fellow, let us have a little more light.”

[Bilbo brings a candle to the table, where Gandalf has spread out a map which was in his pocket.]

[Gandalf:] “Far to the East, over ranges and rivers, beyond woodlands and wastelands, lies a single solitary peak.”



[Bilbo-reading the map:] “The Lonely Mountain.”

[Gloin:] “Aye. Oin has read the portents, and the portents say it is time.”

[Oin:] “Ravens have been seen flying back to the mountain as it was foretold: When the birds of yore return to Erebor, the reign of the beast will end.”

[Bilbo, hearing “the beast,” looks concerned.]

[Bilbo:] “Uh, What beast?”

[Bofur:] “Well that would be a reference to Smaug the Terrible, chiefest and greatest calamity of our age. Airborne fire-breather, teeth like razors, claws like meathooks, extremely fond of precious metals--”

[Bilbo:] “Yes, I know what a dragon is.”

[Ori:] “I’m not afraid! I’m up for it. I’ll give him a taste of the Dwarfish iron right up his jacksie.”

[Several dwarves shout.]

[Dori:] “Sit down!”

[Balin:] “The task would be difficult enough with an army behind us. But we number just thirteen, and not thirteen of the best, nor brightest.”

[The dwarves start objecting, saying things like, “Hey, who are you calling dim?” “Watch it!”, and “No!”]

[Oin:] “What did he say?”

[Fili:] “We may be few in number, but we’re fighters, all of us, to the last dwarf!”

[Kili:] “And you forget, we have a wizard in our company. Gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons in his time.”

[Gandalf:] “Oh, well, now, uh, I-I-I wouldn’t say that, I- -”

[Dori:] “How many, then?”

[Gandalf:] “Uh, what?”

[Dori:] “Well, how many dragons have you killed? Go on, give us a number!”

[Gandalf:] “Hm.”

[Gandalf embarrassedly starts coughing on his pipe smoke; the dwarves jump to their feet, arguing about the number of dragons Gandalf has killed. Thorin jumps up in anger and bellows, silencing the rest.]

[Thorin:] “Shazara! [not translated onscreen: Silence!] If we have read these signs, do you not think others will have read them too? Rumours have begun to spread. The dragon Smaug has not been seen for 60 years. Eyes look east to the Mountain, assessing, wondering, weighing the risk. Perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected. Do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours? Or do we seize this chance to take back Erebor? Du Bekâr! Du Bekâr! [not translated onscreen: To arms! To arms!]”

[All the dwarves cheer.]

[Balin:] “You forget: the front gate is sealed. There is no way into the mountain.”

[Gandalf:] “That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.”

[Twiddling his fingers, Gandalf produces a dwarvish key, ornately wrought. Thorin looks at it in wonder.]

[Thorin:] “How came you by this?”

[Gandalf:] “It was given to me by your father, by Thrain, for safekeeping. It is yours now.”

[Gandalf hands the key to Thorin as everyone looks on in wonder.]

[Fili:] “If there is a key, there must be a door.”

[Gandalf points at runes on his map with his pipe.]

[Gandalf:] “These runes speak of a hidden passage to the lower halls.”

[Kili:] “There’s another way in!”

[Gandalf:] “Well, if we can find it, but dwarf doors are invisible when closed. The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map and I do not have the skill to find it. But there are others in Middle-earth who can. The task I have in mind will require a great deal of stealth, and no small amount of courage. But, if we are careful and clever, I believe that it can be done.”

[Ori:] “That’s why we need a burglar.”

[Bilbo:] “Hm, A good one, too. An expert, I’d imagine.”

[Gloin:] “And are you?”

[Bilbo:] “Am I what?”

[Oin:] “He said he’s an expert! Hey hey!”

[Several dwarves laugh.]

[Bilbo:] “M--Me? No, no, no, no, no. I’m not a burglar; I’ve never stolen a thing in my life.”

[Balin:] “I’m afraid I have to agree with Mr. Baggins. He’s hardly burglar material.”

[Bilbo nods in agreement.]

[Dwalin:] “Aye, the wild is no place for gentlefolk who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.”

[Bilbo continues nodding in agreement; the dwarves begin arguing. Gandalf, growing angry, rises to his full height and casts darkness over the group as starts speaking in his “powerful” voice. The others stop in awe.]

[Gandalf:] “Enough! If I say Bilbo Baggins is a burglar, then a burglar he is.”

[Gandalf goes back to his normal self.]	

[Gandalf:] “Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet. In fact, they can pass unseen by most if they choose. And while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of dwarf, the scent of hobbit is all but unknown to him, which gives us a distinct advantage. You asked me to find the fourteenth member of this company, and I have chosen Mr. Baggins. There’s a lot more to him than appearances suggest, and he’s got a great deal more to offer than any of you know, including himself. You must trust me on this.”

[Thorin:] “Very well. We will do it your way. 

[Bilbo:] “No, no, no.”

[Thorin:] “Give him the contract.”

[Bilbo:] “Please.”

[Bofur:] “Alright, we’re off!”

[Balin hands Bilbo a long contract.]

[Balin:] “It’s just the usual summary of out-of-pocket expenses, time required, remuneration, funeral arrangements, so forth.”

[Bilbo:] “Funeral arrangements?”

[As Bilbo steps back a few feet to read the contract, Thorin leans toward Gandalf and whispers to him.]

[Thorin:] “I cannot guarantee his safety.” 

[Gandalf:] “Understood.”

[Thorin:] “Nor will I be responsible for his fate.”

[Gandalf:] “Agreed.”

[Bilbo reads parts of the contract out loud.]

[Bilbo--reading:] “Terms: Cash on delivery, up to but not exceeding one fourteenth of total profit, if any. Seems fair. Eh, Present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by or sustained as a consequence thereof including but not limited to lacerations ... evisceration … incineration?”



[Bofur:] “Oh, aye, he’ll melt the flesh off your bones in the blink of an eye.”

[Bilbo looks a little breathless.]

[Bilbo:] “Huh.”

[Balin:] “You all right, laddie?”

[Bilbo bends over, nauseous and pained.]

[Bilbo:] “Uh, yeah...Feel a bit faint.”

[Bofur:] “Think furnace with wings.”

[Bilbo:] “Air, I--I--I need air.”

[Bofur:] “Flash of light, searing pain, then Poof! you’re nothing more than a pile of ash.”

[Bilbo breathes heavily, trying to compose himself as the others stare at him.]

[Bilbo:] “Hmmm. Nope.”

[Bilbo falls on the floor in a faint.]

[Gandalf:] “Ah, very helpful, Bofur.”



[Bilbo is sitting on his chair, holding a mug and talking to Gandalf.]

[Bilbo:] “I’ll be all right, let me just sit quietly for a moment.”

[Gandalf:] “You’ve been sitting quietly for far too long. Tell me; when did doilies and your mother’s dishes become so important to you? I remember a young Hobbit who always was running off in search of elves and the woods, who’d stay out late, come home after dark, trailing mud and twigs and fireflies. A young Hobbit who would have liked nothing better than to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire. The world is not in your books and maps; it’s out there.”

[Bilbo:] “I can’t just go running off into the blue. I am a Baggins, of Bag End.”

[Gandalf:] “You are also a Took. Did you know that your great-great-great-great-uncle, Bullroarer Took, was so large he could ride a real horse?”

[The camera focuses on a portrait of Bullroarer Took on Bilbo’s wall.]

[Bilbo:] “Yes.”

[Gandalf:] “Well he could. In the Battle of Green Fields, he charged the goblin ranks. He swung his club so hard it knocked the Goblin King’s head clean off, and it sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole. And thus the battle was won, and the game of golf invented at the same time.”

[Bilbo:] “I do believe you made that up.”

[Gandalf:] “Well, all good stories deserve embellishment. You’ll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.”

[Bilbo:] “Can you promise that I will come back?”

[Gandalf:] “No. And if you do, you will not be the same.”	

[Bilbo:] “That’s what I thought. Sorry, Gandalf, I can’t sign this. You’ve got the wrong Hobbit.”

[Bilbo walks away down the hall. Gandalf sighs. Balin and Thorin see Bilbo walking away.]

[Balin:] “It appears we have lost our burglar. Probably for the best. The odds were always against us. After all, what are we? Merchants, miners, tinkers, toy-makers; hardly the stuff of legend.”

[Thorin:] “There are a few warriors amongst us.”

[Balin:] “Old warriors.”

[Thorin:] “I will take each and every one of these dwarves over an army from the Iron Hills. For when I called upon them, they came. Loyalty. Honor. A willing heart. I can ask no more than that.”



[Balin:] “You don’t have to do this. You have a choice. You’ve done honorably by our people. You have built a new life for us in the Blue Mountains, a life of peace and plenty. A life that is worth more than all the gold in Erebor.”

[Thorin holds out the key Gandalf gave him.]

[Thorin:] “From my grandfather to my father, this has come to me. They dreamt of the day when the dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland. There is no choice, Balin. Not for me.”

[Balin:] “Then we are with you, laddie. We will see it done.”



[The dwarves gather in Bilbo’s living room, smoking their pipes by the fire. They all begin humming, and soon Thorin begins to sing, and the others join him (on the second stanza below). Gandalf listens from nearby; Bilbo listens from his bedroom.]



[The dwarves, singing:]
“Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To find our long-forgotten gold

The pines were roaring on the height
The winds were moaning in the night
The fire was red, it flaming spread
The trees like torches blazed with light”

[The camera focuses on sparks floating out of Bilbo’s chimney, then the scene fades into the night sky.]



[It is morning. Bilbo wakes up on his bed, and suddenly realizes that his house is very quiet. He walks all around his house expecting to run into the dwarves; however, there is no one there. The house has been cleaned up completely from the mess of the party last night, almost as if it had never happened.]



[Bilbo:] “Hello?“

[Bilbo looks a bit lonesome. He sees the Contract sitting on a table; he looks at it, then looks up with a determined face.]



[Bilbo runs out the door of Bag End and down the path, wearing a travelling pack and holding the contract. He runs through Hobbiton, jumping over fences and pumpkins in his haste. His neighbors shake their heads at him.]

[Neighbor:] “Hey! Mr. Bilbo! Where are you off to?”

[Bilbo:] “Can’t stop, I’m already late!”

[Neighbor:] “Late for what?”

[Bilbo:] “I’m going on an adventure!”





[The dwarves are riding their ponies, and Gandalf his horse, down a path through a wooded area. A few words of their conversation are heard, including “waste of time” and “use a hobbit”. Bilbo runs up from behind them.]

[Bilbo:] “Wait! Wait!”

[Some dwarves call “Woah!” and stop their ponies. Bilbo catches up to them and hands Balin the contract.]

[Bilbo:] “I signed it!”

[Balin takes the contract and inspects it with a pocket-glass. He then smiles at Bilbo.]

[Balin:] “Everything appears to be in order. Welcome, Master Baggins, to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.”

[The dwarves cheer. Thorin doesn’t look too impressed.]

[Thorin:] “Give him a pony.”

[Bilbo:] “No, no, no, no, that--that won’t be necessary, thank you, but I--I’m sure I can keep up on foot. I-- I--I’ve done my fair share of walking holidays, you know. I even got as far as Frogmorton once--WAGH!”

[Bilbo’s speech is cut off as two of the dwarves ride alongside him and pick him up from behind to put him on a pony.]



[Bilbo is riding a pony and looking quite terrified. The pony neighs and tosses its head, making him quite uncomfortable..]

[Oin:] “Come on, Nori, pay up. Go on.”

[Nori tosses a sack of money to Oin; sacks of money begin passing between the dwarves.]

[Oin:] “Hey, hey, hey!”

[Some of the dwarves laugh.]

[Bilbo:] “What’s that about?”

[Gandalf:] “Oh, they took wagers on whether or not you’d turn up. Most of them bet that you wouldn’t.”

[Bilbo:] “What did you think?”

[Gandalf:] “Hmmm.”

[Gandalf catches a sack of money tossed to him and puts it in his bag.]

[Gandalf:] “My dear fellow, I never doubted you for a second.”

[Bilbo sneezes loudly.]

[Bilbo:] “Ohh. All this horse hair, I’m having a reaction.”

[Bilbo searches his pockets for his handkerchief. He is unable to find it, and he looks up in shock.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, wait, wait, stop! Stop! We have to turn around.”

[The entire company comes to a halt, and the dwarves start objecting and asking what the problem is.]

[Gandalf:] “What on earth is the matter?”

[Bilbo:] “I forgot my handkerchief.”

[Bofur tears a strip of cloth from his clothing and tosses it to Bilbo.]

[Bofur:] “Here! Use this.”

[Bilbo catches the rag and looks at it in disgust. The dwarves laugh and begin to continue their journey.]

[Thorin:] “Move on.”

[Gandalf:] “You’ll have to manage without pocket-handkerchiefs and a good many other things, Bilbo Baggins, before we reach our journey’s end. You were born to the rolling hills and little rivers of the Shire, but home is now behind you; the world is ahead.”

[We see the Company travelling through many beautiful areas of Middle-earth, including forest, hills, and plains.]



[The company has camped for the night near the edge of a cliff. As Gloin sleeps, tiny flying insects get sucked into his mouth every time he inhales, and they are expelled when he exhales. Bilbo watches in disgust, then finally gets up and walks around. Most of the dwarves are asleep; Gandalf, Fili, and Kili are awake. Bilbo walks over to his pony and gives her an apple, after checking to see that no one is looking.]

[Bilbo:] “Hello, girl. That’s a good girl. It’s our little secret, Myrtle; you must tell no one. sh, sh”

[Bilbo hears a scream in the night air and becomes worried. He runs over to Fili and Kili.]

[Bilbo:] “What was that?”

[Kili:] “Orcs.”

[Another scream is heard. Thorin, who was dozing, jerks awake upon hearing the word “Orcs.”]

[Bilbo:] “Orcs?”

[Fili:] “Throat-cutters. There’ll be dozens of them out there. The lowlands are crawling with them.”

[Kili:] “They strike in the wee small hours, when everyone’s asleep. Quick and quiet; no screams, just lots of blood.”

[Bilbo looks away in fright; Fili and Kili look at each other and begin laughing.]

[Thorin:] “You think that’s funny? You think a night raid by orcs is a joke?”

[Kili:] “We didn’t mean anything by it.”

[Thorin:] “No, you didn’t. You know nothing of the world.”   

[Thorin walks off to the edge of the cliff and looks out over the valley; Balin walks up to Fili and Kili.]



[Balin:] “Don’t mind him, laddie. Thorin has more cause than most to hate orcs. After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain, King Thror tried to reclaim the ancient dwarf kingdom of Moria. But our enemy had got there first.”

[Flashback of the Battle of Azanulbizar; thousand of dwarves and orcs fight in front of the gates of Moria. We see Thorin, Thror, Thrain, Balin, and Dwalin fighting fiercely. A massive, pale, orc wipes out many dwarves with his mace, then engages King Thror.]

[Balin:] “Moria had been taken by legions of Orcs lead by the most vile of all their race: Azog, the Defiler. The giant Gundabad Orc had sworn to wipe out the line of Durin. He began by beheading the King.”

[Azog, having defeated King Thror, holds up his beheaded head as he roars; he then flings the head, which bounces and rolls to Thorin’s feet.]

[Thorin, in flashback:] “Nooo!”

[Balin:] “Thrain, Thorin’s father, was driven mad by grief. He went missing, taken prisoner or killed, we did not know. We were leaderless. Defeat and death were upon us.”

[In the flashback, the orcs have overpowered the dwarves, and the dwarves flee for their lives.]

[Balin:] “That is when I saw him: a young dwarf prince facing down the Pale Orc.”

[Thorin faces Azog; Azog swings his mace and knocks away first Thorin’s shield, then his sword. Thorin falls down an embankment and lands on the ground.]

[Balin:] “He stood alone against this terrible foe, his armor rent…wielding nothing but an oaken branch as a shield”

[Azog leaps to smash Thorin, but Thorin, grabbing an oaken branch lying on the round, manages to roll away in time. Azog continues wielding his mace against Thorin, who is still on the ground, but Thorin blocks his mace with the oaken branch, which he uses as a shield. As Azog swings one last time, Thorin, grabbing a sword lying nearby, cuts off Azog’s left arm, his mace arm, from below the elbow. Azog clutches the stump of his arm as he howls in pain.]

[Balin:] “Azog, the Defiler, learned that day that the line of Durin would not be so easily broken.”

[Azog is rushed into Moria by other orcs; Thorin, yelling “Du Bekâr! Du Bekâr!” (not translated onscreen: ‘To arms! To arms!’), rallies the dwarves to battle. They stop fleeing and return to battle, fighting ferociously. The dwarves now seem to have the advantage.]

[Balin:] “Our forces rallied and drove the orcs back. Our enemy had been defeated. But there was no feast, no song, that night, for our dead were beyond the count of grief. We few had survived.”

[The battlefield is covered in the corpses of dwarves and orcs; the surviving dwarves weep with one another over their loss. A younger Balin and Dwalin hug and put their foreheads together as they weep. Balin, still weeping, looks up and sees Thorin framed in the sunlight, holding his oaken branch.]

[Balin:] “And I thought to myself then, there is one who I could follow. There is one I could call King.”

[In the present, Thorin turns away from the view beyond the cliff; the entire Company is awake and standing in awe, staring at him. Thorin walks between them toward the fire.]



[Bilbo:] “But the pale orc? What happened to him?”

[Thorin:] “He slunk back into the hole whence he came. That filth died of his wounds long ago.”

[The camera zooms away from the Company’s campsite, and focuses on another cliff across the valley. A group of Wargs and Orcs is there, spying on the Company. Yazneg, their leader, talks to the rest.]

[Yazneg:] “Send word to the Master. We have found the Dwarf-scum.”



[The Company rides their ponies through a muddy forest as it rains. They all look cold, wet, and miserable.]

[Dori:] “Here, Mr. Gandalf, can’t you do something about this deluge?”

[Gandalf:] “It is raining, Master Dwarf, and it will continue to rain until the rain is done. If you wish to change the weather of the world, you should find yourself another wizard.”

[Bilbo:] “Are there any?”

[Gandalf:] “What?”

[Bilbo:] “Other wizards?”

[Gandalf:] “There are five of us. The greatest of our order is Saruman, the White. Then there are the two Blue Wizards; you know, I’ve quite forgotten their names.”

[Bilbo:] “And who is the fifth?”

[Gandalf:] “Well, that would be Radagast, the Brown.”

[Bilbo:] “Is he a great Wizard or is he...more like you?”

[Gandalf looks slightly offended.]

[Gandalf:] “I think he’s a very great wizard, in his own way. He’s a gentle soul who prefers the company of animals to others. He keeps a watchful eye over the vast forest lands to the East, and a good thing too, for always Evil will look to find a foothold in this world.”



[Radagast runs through a forest. He examines a dying plant.]

[Radagast:] “Not good; not good at all.”

[As Radagast continues running, we see many dead animals lying around. Radagast plucks a mushroom and puts it in his bag. He feels and tastes the sap of a tree which appears to be infected; he grows more and more worried. He whistles, and his bird appears. Radagast lifts his hat, and the bird and its mate land in their nest, which is on Radagast’s head. Radagast gasps and runs over to a hedgehog lying on the floor; it appears to be dying. He cradles it.]

[Radagast:] “Oh no! Sebastian! Good gracious.”

[Running through the forest, Radagast brings Sebastian to his home, Rhosgobel. There, he attempts to cure the hedgehog using various medicinal and magical techniques, to no avail. The hedgehog’s family surround it, and Radagast tells them to move.]


[Radagast:] “Move back! Give him some air, for goodness sake!”

[Radagast continues his treatments, but they don’t work. The hedgehog writhes in pain.]

[Radagast:] “I don’t understand why it’s not working; it’s not as if it’s witchcraft...”

[A strange look comes over his face, and he speaks in a different, deeper voice than before.]

[Radagast:] “Witchcraft. But it is. A dark and powerful magic.”

[Hearing a noise, Radagast looks up and sees several giant spiders crawling up the side of his house. Radagast hurriedly braces his door shut with a bench. The hedgehog suddenly croaks, gasping for air, then seemingly expires. Radagast seems to be about to cry; however, the house starts creaking with the sound of the spiders crawling over the roof. Radagast runs over to his staff and pulls out the blue stone embedded at the top. As all the small rodents and other animals in his house flee, Radagast cradles Sebastian and whispers a spell, while holding the blue stone to the hedgehog’s muzzle.]

[Radagast:] “Lerya laman naiquentallo” [not translated onscreen: Free the animal from the curse]. “Sí a hlare ómaquettar” [not translated onscreen: Now hear words of my voice]  “Na coilerya en-vinyanta” [not translated onscreen: Be its life renewed]. Sí a hlare ómaquettar. Na coilerya en-vinyanta.”

[The spiders begin to break through the thatched roof. Radagast goes into a trance-like state, and his spell grows more and more powerful, as darkness falls over the house. A black, inky shadow is slowly extracted from the hedgehog and into the stone. Suddenly, the hedgehog gasps for air and wakes up, and light returns to the area; the spiders crawl off the house. Running outside, Radagast sees spider webs all around his house, and he sees the giant spiders crawling off into the forest.]

[Radagast:] “Where on this good earth did those foul creatures come from?”

[His bird flies to him, and he converses with it.]

[Radagast:] “The old fortress? Show me.”  

[Radagast rides through the forest on a sleigh pulled by several large rabbits. As he proceeds, the forest become dark and gloomy, covered in cobwebs. An old, ruined fortress is seen in the distance.]



[The Company arrives at an old, abandoned farmhouse that is in ruins.]

[Thorin:] “We’ll camp here for the night. Fili, Kili, look after the ponies. Make sure you stay with them.”

[Gandalf:] “A farmer and his family used to live here.”

[Thorin:] “Oin, Gloin.”

[Gloin:] “Aye?”

[Thorin:] “Get a fire going.”

[Gloin:] “Right you are.”

[Gandalf:] “I think it would be wiser to move on. We could make for the Hidden Valley.”

[Thorin:] “I have told you already, I will not go near that place.”

[Gandalf:] “Why not? The elves could help us. We could get food, rest, advice.”

[Thorin:] “I do not need their advice.”

[Gandalf:] “We have a map that we cannot read. Lord Elrond could help us.”

[Thorin:] “Help? A dragon attacks Erebor, what help came from the Elves? Orcs plunder Moria, desecrate our sacred halls, the Elves looked on and did nothing. You ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather and betrayed my father.”

[Gandalf:] “You are neither of them. I did not give you that map and key for you to hold on to the past.”

[Thorin:] “I did not know that they were yours to keep.”

[Gandalf stomps off angrily, leaving the Company.]

[Bilbo:] “Everything alright? Gandalf, where are you going?”

[Gandalf:] “To seek the company of the only one around here who’s got any sense.”

[Bilbo:] “Who’s that?”

[Gandalf:] “Myself, Mr. Baggins! I’ve had enough of dwarves for one day.”

[Thorin:] “Come on, Bombur, we’re hungry.”

[Bilbo, to Balin:] “Is he coming back?”

[Balin looks unsure.]



[It is nighttime; Bombur has prepared a dinner of soup, and the dwarves are eating it.]

[Bilbo:] “He’s been a long time.”

[Bofur:] “Who?”

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf.”

[Bofur:] “He’s a wizard! He does as he chooses. Here, do us a favor: take this to the lads.”

[Bofur hands Bilbo two bowls of soup to take to Fili and Kili; Bilbo leaves. Bombur tries to take more soup.]

[Bofur:] “Stop it, you’ve had plenty.”

[Bilbo goes out in the dark to where Fili and Kili are watching the ponies. They are staring out into the dark and don’t take the soup from Bilbo when he hands it to them.]

[Bilbo:] “What’s the matter?”

[Kili:] “We’re supposed to be looking out for the ponies.”

[Fili:] “Only we’ve encountered a slight problem.”

[Kili:] “We had sixteen.”

[Fili:] “Now there’s fourteen.”

[They all examine the group of ponies.]

[Kili:] “Daisy and Bungo are missing.”

[Bilbo:] “Well, that’s not good. That is not good at all. Shouldn’t we tell Thorin?”

[Fili:] “Uhh, no. Let’s not worry him. As our official burglar, we thought you might like to look into it.”

[Bilbo looks around and sees some trees recently uprooted and laying on the ground.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, uh...look, some--something big uprooted these trees.”

[Kili:] “That was our thinking.”

[Bilbo:] “Something very big, and possibly quite dangerous.”

[Fili:] “Hey! There’s a light. Over here! Stay down.”

[As the three of them quietly run through the forest toward the light Fili has seen, and they hide behind a log when they realize that it is a fire. Harsh laughter sounds from near the fire.]



[Bilbo:] “What is it?”

[Kili:] “Trolls.”

[Fili and Kili run toward the fire; Bilbo starts to follow them, then returns to grab the two bowls of soup he left on the log. He then continues following them. Bilbo hides behind a tree and sees a massive mountain troll walking toward the fire, carrying a pony under each arm.]

[Bilbo:] “He’s got Myrtle and Minty! I think they’re going to eat them, we have to do something.”

[Kili:] “Yes; you should. Mountain trolls are slow and stupid, and you’re so small.”

[Bilbo:] “N--n--no--”

[Kili:] “They’ll never see you.”

[Bilbo:] “No, no, no...”

[Kili:] “It’s perfectly safe! We’ll be right behind you.”

[Fili:] “If you run into trouble, hoot twice like a barn owl, once like a brown owl.”

[Fili and Kili push Bilbo toward the fire. He begins whispering Fili’s instructions to himself, trying to remember them, but gets mixed up.]

[Bilbo:] “Twice like a barn owl, twice like a brown--once like a brown? Are you sure this is a good idea?”

[Bilbo turns around, but Fili and Kili are already out of sight. The three trolls, Tom, Bert, and William, sit around a fire on which a cauldron of something is cooking. Tom is the troll who brought the ponies. William has on a dirty vest. Bert is the cook and is wearing an apron.]



[Bert:] “Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don’t look like mutton again tomorrow.”

[Tom:] “Quit yer’ griping. These ain’t sheep. These is West Nags!”

[William:] “Oh, I don’t like `orse. I never `ave. Not enough fat on them.”

[Bert:] “Well, it’s better than the leathery old farmer. All skin and bone, he was. I’m still picking bits of him out of me teeth.”

[William sneezes into the pot they have boiling over a fire.]

[Bert:] “Oh, that’s lovely, that is; a floater.”

[Tom:] “Oh, might improve the flavor!”

[William:] “Ah! There’s more where that came from.”

[He begins to sneeze more, but Bert grabs him by the nose. Bilbo, unseen, gets behind them.]

[Bert:] “Oh no you don’t.”

[Bert throws William down.]

[William:] “Ow! Ow! Ow!”

[Bert:] “Sit down.”

[William sneezes again, this time into a handkerchief he pulls out from behind him. He sniffs for a long time. Bilbo, reaching the pen in which the ponies are held, attempts to untie the ropes. He hides as William turns towards him.]

[William:] “I hope you’re gonna gut these nags. I don’t like the stinky parts.”

[Bert hits William with his ladle, and William squeals in pain.]

[Bert:] “I said sit down!”

[Tom:] “I’m starving! Are we `aving horse tonight or what?”

[Bert:] “Shut your cakehole. You’ll eat what I give ya’.”

[As William pulls out his handkerchief, Bilbo sees that he’s wearing a long knife in his belt. Bilbo, unable to untie the ropes restraining the ponies, attempts to get the knife from the troll.]

[Tom:] “How come ‘e’s the cook? Everything tastes the same. Everything tastes like chicken.”

[William:] “Except the chicken.”
  
[Tom:] “That tastes like fish!”

[Bert:] “I’m just saying, a little appreciation would be nice. ‘Thank you very much, Bert,’ ‘Lovely stew, Bert’; how hard is that? Hmm, it just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.”

[William picks up a mug of drink, but Tom gets mad at him.]

[Bert:] “There, that’s my grog!”

[William:] “Uhh, uhh, sorry.”

[Bert hits William with his ladle again, knocking him down. He gets back up. Bert tastes the soup in his ladle.]

[Bert:] “Ooh, that is beautifully balanced, that is.”

[Bert lets Tom taste some of the soup in the ladle; Tom gulps it down.]

[Bert:] “Wrap your [indistinguishable] around that, mate. Eh? Good, innit? Heh, heh, heh. That’s why I’m the cook.”

[Bilbo gets behind William and tries to reach for the knife, but William stand up and scratches his bottom. Bilbo is disgusted.]

[Tom:] “Me guts are grumbling, I’ve got to snaffle something. Flesh I need, flesh!”

[Wiilliam, about to sneeze, reaches behind him for his handkerchief, but accidentally grabs Bilbo instead, and sneezes all over him. He then realizes that he’s not holding any ordinary booger.]

[William:] “Argh!!! Blimey! Bert! Bert! Look what’s come out of me ‘ooter! It’s got arms and legs and everything.”

[The other trolls gather around to look.]

[Tom:] “What is it?”

[William:] “I don’t know, but I don’t like the way it wriggles around!”

[William shakes Bilbo, covered in snot, off the napkin and onto the ground.]

[Tom:] “What are you then? An oversized squirrel?”

[Bilbo:] “I’m a burglar-- uhh, Hobbit.”

[William:] “A Burgla-Hobbit?”

[Tom:] “Can we cook `im?

[William:] “We can try!”

[William tries to grab Bilbo, but he dodges, only to be cornered by Bert.]

[Bert:] “He wouldn’t make more than a mouthful, not when he’s skinned and boned!”

[Tom:] “Perhaps there’s more Burglar-Hobbits around these parts. Might be enough for a pie.”

[Bert:] “Grab him!”

[William:] “It’s too quick!”

[As the trolls try to catch Bilbo, he runs around trying to dodge them. Bert accidentally hits William with his ladle while trying to hit Bilbo. Bilbo is eventually caught by the legs by Tom, and held upside down in the air.]

[Tom:] “Come here, you little... Gotcha! Are there any more of you little fellas `iding where you shouldn’t?”

[Bilbo:] “Nope.”

[William:] “He’s lying.”

[Bilbo:] “No I’m not!”

[William:] “Hold his toes over the fire.  Make him squeal.”

[Kili suddenly runs out of the bushes and cuts William in the leg, making him howl and fall down.]

[Kili:] “Drop him!”

[Tom:] “You what?”

[Kili:] “I said, drop him.”

[Tom throws Bilbo at Kili; Bilbo lands on Kili, knocking them both down. The rest of the Company charges out of the bushes yelling and brandishing their weapons. They begin fighting the trolls, hacking, slashing, and hammering their legs. As the dwarves fight, Bilbo grabs William’s knife and cuts the ropes, freeing the ponies. Tom, seeing this, grabs Bilbo. The dwarves stop fighting when they see the trolls holding Bilbo by the arms and legs.]

[Kili:] “Bilbo!”

[Thorin:] “No!”

[Tom:] “Lay down your arms, or we’ll rip his off.”

[Thorin looks at Bilbo in frustration, then plants his sword in the ground. The others drop their swords and weapons as well.]


     
[The trolls have tied several dwarves (Dwalin, Bofur, Dori, Ori and Nori) onto a spit and are roasting them over a fire; the rest (Thorin, Kili, Gloin, Bombur, Balin and Oin), and Bilbo, are tied up in sacks nearby.]

[William:] “Don’t bother cooking them. Let’s just sit on them and squash them into jelly.”

[Bert:] “They should be sautéed and grilled with a sprinkle of sage.”

[Dori:] “Is this really necessary?”

[William:] “Ooh, that does sound quite nice.”

[Oin:] “Untie us, you monsters!” 
[Gloin:] “Take on someone your own size!” 

[The dwarves on the spit and in the bags are all making noises and talking in fear.]

[Tom:] “Never mind the seasoning; we ain’t got all night! Dawn ain’t far away, so let’s get a move on. I don’t fancy being turned to stone.”

[Bilbo, hearing what Tom said, has an idea.]

[Bilbo:] “Wait! You are making a terrible mistake.”

[Dori:] “You can’t reason with them, they’re half-wits!”

[Bofur:] “Half-wits? What does that make us?”

[Bilbo manages to stand up, although still tied up in a sack. He faces the trolls.]

[Bilbo:] “Uh, I meant with the, uh, with, uh, with the seasoning.”

[Bert:] “What about the seasoning?”

[Bilbo:] “Well have you smelt them? You’re going to need something stronger than sage before you plate this lot up.”

[The dwarves yell at Bilbo, calling him a traitor. The ones in sacks kick him.]

[Tom:] “What do you know about cooking dwarf?”

[Bert:] “Shut up, and let the, uh, flurgaburburrahobbit talk.”

[Bilbo:] “Uh, th--the secret to cooking dwarf is, um--”

[Bert:] “Yes? Come on.

[Bilbo:] “It’s, uh--”

[Bert:] “Tell us the secret.”

[Bilbo:] “Ye--yes, I’m telling you, the secret is … to skin them first!”

[Bert:] “Tom, get me the filleting knife.”

[Gloin:] “If I get you, you little--” 

[Dwalin:] “I won’t forget that!” 

[Tom:] “What a load of rubbish! I’ve eaten plenty with their skins on. Scuff them, I say, boots and all.”

[Bilbo sees Gandalf slipping behind some trees nearby.]

[William:] “`e’s right! Nothing wrong with a bit of raw dwarf! Nice and crunchy.”

[William grabs Bombur, who is in a sack, and dangles him upside down over his mouth, about to eat him.]

[Bilbo:] “Not--not that one, he--he’s infected!”

[Tom:] “You what?”

[Bilbo:] “Yeah, He’s got worms in his … tubes.”



[William drops Bombur back into the pile of Dwarves in disgust.]

[Bilbo:] “In--in fact they all have, they’re in--infested with parasites. It’s a terrible business; I wouldn’t risk it, I really wouldn’t.”

[Oin:] “Parasites, did he say parasites?”

[Kili:] “We don’t have parasites! You have parasites!”

[Gloin:] “What are you talking about, laddie?” 

[The rest of the dwarves chime in about how they don’t have parasites and how Bilbo is a fool. Bilbo rolls his eyes as the dwarves mess up his plan. Thorin, understand Bilbo’s plan, kicks the others. They then understand and go along with it. All the dwarves begin proclaiming about how they’re “riddled” with parasites.]

[Oin:] “I’ve got parasites as big as my arm.”

[Kili:] “Mine are the biggest parasites, I’ve got huge parasites!”

[Nori:] “We’re riddled.” 

[Ori:] “Yes, I’m riddled.” 

[Dori:] “Yes we are. Badly!” 

[Tom:] “What would you have us do, then, let ‘em all go?”

[Bilbo:] “Well...”

[Tom:] “You think I don’t know what you’re up to? This little ferret is taking us for fools!”

[Bilbo:] “Ferret?”

[Bert:] “Fools?”

[Gandalf appears on top of a large rock above the clearing.]

[Gandalf:] “The dawn will take you all!”

[Bert:] “Who’s that?”

[Tom:] “No idea.”

[William:] “Can we eat `im too?”

[Gandalf strikes the rock with his staff, splitting it in half, allowing the sunlight behind it to pour into the clearing. When the sunlight touches the trolls’ skin, they begin turning into stone amidst loud screams and howls of pain. Within seconds, there are three stone statues of trolls in the clearing. All the dwarves cheer for Gandalf. Of course, the dwarves on the spit, including Dwalin, still look uncomfortable.]

[Dwalin:] “Oh, get your foot out of my back!”



[It is morning; the dwarves have been freed from the spit and from the sacks. Gandalf walks to one of the troll statues and thumps it with his staff, with a pleased smile on his face.]

[Thorin, to Gandalf:] “Where did you go to, if I may ask?”

[Gandalf:] “To look ahead.”

[Thorin:] “What brought you back?”

[Gandalf:] “Looking behind. Nasty business. Still, they are all in one piece.”

[Thorin:] “No thanks to your burglar.”

[Gandalf:] “He had the nous to play for time. None of the rest of you thought of that.”

[Thorin looks repentant. Gandalf and Thorin examine the statues of the trolls.]

[Gandalf:] “They must have come down from the Ettenmoors.”

[Thorin:] “Since when do mountain trolls venture this far south?”

[Gandalf:] “Oh, not for an age, not since a darker power ruled these lands.”

[Gandalf and Thorin look meaningfully at each other.]

[Gandalf:] “They could not have moved in daylight.”

[Thorin:] “There must be a cave nearby.”



[The company finds a large cave nearby, and they enter it. It is full of treasure the trolls have been hoarding.]

[Nori:] “Oh, what’s that stench?!”

[Gandalf:] “It’s a troll hoard. Be careful what you touch.”

[As they enter the cave, many of the dwarves cough and retch at the pungence. Inside, they find piles of gold coins and other treasure in caskets.]

[Bofur:] “Seems a shame just to leave it lyin’ around. Anyone could take it.”

[Gloin:] “Agreed. Nori, get a shovel.”

[While exploring, Thorin finds two swords covered in cobwebs. Gandalf approaches him.]

[Thorin:] “These swords were not made by any troll.”

[Thorin hands one sword to Gandalf and keeps the other one.]

[Gandalf:] “Nor were they made by any smith among men.”

[Gandalf draws the sword in his hand out of its sheath a few inches.]



[Gandalf:] “These were forged in Gondolin by the High Elves of the First Age.”

[Realizing that they are Elven swords, Thorin starts to put his away in disgust.]

[Gandalf:] “You could not wish for a finer blade.”

[Reluctantly, Thorin holds on to the sword. He draws it out of its sheath a few inches as well.]
[Some of the dwarves fill a chest with treasure, then bury it in a hole in the ground. Dwalin looks on in disgust.]

[Gloin:] “We’re makin’ a long term deposit.”

[Thorin:] “Let’s get out of this foul place. Come on, let’s go. Bofur! Gloin! Nori!”

[On his way out, Gandalf steps on something metallic. Brushing aside the leaves beneath him with his staff, he finds another sword. Gandalf exits the cave and heads over to where Bilbo is sitting. He hands Bilbo the sword he just found.]

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo”. 

[Bilbo:] “Hmm?”

[Gandalf:] “Here. This is about your size.”

[Bilbo:] “I can’t take this.”

[Gandalf:] “The blade is of Elvish make which means it will glow blue when orcs or goblins are nearby.”

[Bilbo:] “I have never used a sword in my life.”

[Gandalf:] “And I hope you never have to. But if you do, remember this: true courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.”

[Thorin:] “Something’s coming!”

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf-”

[Gandalf:] “Stay together! Hurry now. Arm yourselves.”

[Bilbo slowly draws his sword and looks at it. He then follows the others, who have run off into the woods.]



[Radagast rides at full speed through the forest on his rabbit-drawn sled. He pulls up short by the Company.]

[Radagast:] “Thieves! Fire! Murder!”

[Gandalf:] “Radagast! Radagast the Brown. Ah. What on earth are you doing here?”

[Radagast:] “I was looking for you, Gandalf. Something’s wrong. Something’s terribly wrong.”

[Gandalf:] “Yes?”

[Radagast opens his mouth to speak, but shuts it. He opens his mouth again, but closes it again. He has forgotten what he was going to say.]    

[Radagast:] “Oh, just give me a minute. Um, oh, I had a thought, and now I’ve lost it. It was, it was right there, on the tip of my tongue.”

[He curls up his tongue, and looks surprised.]

[Radagast:] “Oh, it’s not a thought at all; it’s a silly old...”

[Gandalf pulls a stick insect out of Radagast’s mouth.]

[Radagast:] “-stick insect!”

[The dwarves and Bilbo look flustered. Radagast and Gandalf go off a few paces and speak privately.]



[Radagast:] “The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf. A darkness has fallen over it. Nothing grows any more, at least nothing good. The air is foul with decay. But worst are the webs.”

[Gandalf:] “Webs? What do you mean?”

[Radagast:] “Spiders, Gandalf. Giant ones. Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant, or I am not a Wizard. I followed their trail. They came from Dol Guldur.”

[Gandalf:] “Dol Guldur? But the old fortress is abandoned.”

[Radagast:] “No, Gandalf, it is not.”

[Flashback to when Radagast explored the old fortress when he chased after the spiders which attacked Rhosgobel.]
[Radagast crosses a stone bridge and enters a dark, ruined fortress, his staff at the ready.]

[Radagast, narrating:] “A dark power dwells there, such as I have never felt before. It is the shadow of an ancient horror.”

[As Radagast walks through the seemingly abandoned fortress, a statue behind him slowly clenches its fingers around the hilt of its sword.]

[Radagast, narrating:] “One that can summon the spirits of the dead.”  

[The spirit of a king, possibly the Witch-king of Angmar, attacks Radagast, but he fends it off with his staff. As the spirit disappears with a screech, it drops its blade.]

[Radagast, narrating:] “I saw him, Gandalf. From out of the darkness, a Necromancer has come.”	

[Radagast sees a black shadow take the form of a man, and it whispers a dangerous-sounding speech. Radagast flees from the castle, pursued by bats. He calls to his rabbits which are waiting with the sled.]

[Radagast:] “Quick! Quickly! Run! Wait for me!”

[The rabbits start running, and Radagast has to run hard to catch up with and jump onto his sled. He races through the forest with the bats behind him, dodging tree trunks and hitting the bats with his staff.]
[In the present, Radagast “wakes up” from his flashback, and realizes that he has gotten very excited.]

[Radagast:] “I’m sorry.”

[Gandalf:] “Try a bit of Old Toby. It’ll help settle your nerves.”

[Gandalf cleans his pipe with his beard, then offers it to Radagast. Radagast breathes in the smoke.]

[Gandalf:] “And out.”

[Radagast, with his eyes crossed and a blissful look on his face, blows out the smoke, then stays in a trance-like state for a few seconds.]

[Gandalf:] “Now, a Necromancer. Are you sure?”

[Radagast pulls out a cloth-wrapped package and hands it to Gandalf. Gandalf unties it and opens it; upon seeing its contents, which the camera doesn’t see, he looks concerned.]

[Radagast:] “That is not from the world of the living.”

[Suddenly, a howl is heard in the distance.]

[Bilbo:] “Was that a wolf? Are there--are there wolves out there?”

[Bofur:] “Wolves? No, that is not a wolf.”

[From behind a nearby crag, a Warg appears; it leaps into the midst of the Company, knocking down one of the dwarves. Thorin strikes and kills it using  Orcrist. Another Warg attacks from the other side; Kili shoots it with an arrow, bringing it down. However, it gets back up, only to be killed by Dwalin.]

[Thorin:] “Warg-Scouts! Which means an Orc pack is not far behind.”

[Bilbo:] “Orc pack?”

[Gandalf:] “Who did you tell about your quest, beyond your kin?”

[Thorin:] “No one.”

[Gandalf:] “Who did you tell?”

[Thorin:] “No one, I swear. What in Durin’s name is going on?”

[Gandalf:]“You are being hunted.”

[Dwalin:] “We have to get out of here.”

[Ori:] “We can’t! We have no ponies; they bolted.”

[Radagast:] “I’ll draw them off.”

[Gandalf:] “These are Gundabad Wargs; they will outrun you.”

[Radagast:] “These are Rhosgobel Rabbits; I’d like to see them try.”


  
[Yazneg, the orc leader of the Warg Riders, and his Wargs are searching through the forest for the Company; suddenly, Radagast and his rabbits shoot out of the forest, and the Wargs start chasing him.]

[Radagast:] “Come and get me! Ha ha!”

[Gandalf watches from behind a rock as Radagast and the Wargs disappear in the distance.]

[Gandalf:] “Come on!”

[The Company rushes across a rocky plain. In the distance, Radagast is being chased by the Wargs. One of them crashes while trying to catch him. As the Company runs across the plain, they see the Wargs not too far from them, so they hide behind the rocks.]

[Gandalf:] “Stay together.”

[Thorin:] “Move!”

[As the Company runs, Radagast drives his sled beneath an overhanging projection of rock; he ducks, but the Orc on the Warg behind him gets knocked off.]
[As the chase continues, Thorin stops behind a rock so that he is not seen by the Wargs. Ori starts to run out of the cover.]

[Thorin:] “Ori, no! Come back!”

[Gandalf:] “Come on! Quick!”

[As the dwarves continue running, Thorin turns to Gandalf.]

[Thorin:] “Where are you leading us?”

[Gandalf doesn’t answer. As the Warg scouts chase Radagast, one of them stops and scents the air. The dwarves take cover behind an outcropping of rock. The scout and his Warg appear on top of the outcropping, scenting the air. Thorin looks at Kili and nods; readying an arrow, Kili quickly steps out and shoots the Warg. The Warg and the orc on it fall near the dwarves, and the dwarves kill them. The sounds of their fight carry quite far; the other Wargs and Orcs stop chasing Radagast as they hear roars and screams from behind the rocks.]



[Yazneg:] “The Dwarf-scum are over there! After them!”
 
[The Warg scouts howl as they stop pursuing Radagast and begin pursuing the Company.]

[Gandalf:] “Move. Run!”  

[The company runs through a grassy plain; Wargs begin to surround them from all sides.]

[Gloin:] “There they are!”

[Gandalf:] “This way! Quickly!”

[They run for a while longer, then halt in a clearing as they see Wargs on all sides.]

[Kili:] “There’s more coming!”

[Thorin:] “Kili! Shoot them!”

[Looking around, Gandalf sees a large rock; he runs toward it and disappears.]

[Fili:] “We’re surrounded!

[Kili begins shooting at the Warg and the Warg-riders, killing some of them.]

[Kili:] “Where is Gandalf?”

[Dwalin:] “He has abandoned us!”

[The dwarves gather close to each other near the rock Gandalf disappeared by. As Yazneg and his Warg approach, Ori shoots a rock at Yazneg with his slingshot, to no effect. Thorin pulls out his sword.]

[Thorin:] “Hold your ground!”



[Gandalf pops up from a crack in the rock.]

[Gandalf:] “This way, you fools!”	

[Thorin:] “Come on, move! Quickly, all of you! Go, go, go!”

[As the Wargs approach, the dwarves and Bilbo slide into the large crack in the rock, sliding into a cave. Thorin kills a Warg that gets too close. Kili shoots another.]

[Gandalf:] “Nine, ten” 

[Thorin:] “Kili! Run!”

[Thorin and Kili jump into the crack last. Just as Yazneg and his Wargs reach the crack, an Elvish horn sounds, and a group of mounted Elves rush into the fray, shooting and spearing the Wargs and Orcs. The Company listens to the conflict from inside the crack. One of the orcs, shot by an arrow, falls into the cave. Thorin plucks out the arrow and examines its make.]

[Thorin:] “Elves.”

[There is a pathway at the end of the cave, leading away.]

[Dwalin:] “I cannot see where the pathway leads. Do we follow it or no?”

[Bofur:] “Follow it, of course!”

[Gandalf:] “I think that would be wise.”

[The Company begins following the path. It is quite narrow, and it is a crack between two tall cliffs. At times, the dwarves have difficulty going through. The pathway eventually opens out into an open area; there is a valley below, and in that valley is the city of Rivendell.]



[Gandalf:] “The Valley of Imraldis. In the Common Tongue, it’s known by a another name.”

[Bilbo:] “Rivendell.”

[Gandalf:] “Here lies the last Homely House east of the sea.”

[Thorin:] “This was your plan all along, to seek refuge with our enemy.”

[Gandalf:] “You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield. The only ill-will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself.”

[Thorin:] “You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing? They will try to stop us.”

[Gandalf:] “Of course they will. But we have questions that need to be answered. If we are to be successful, this will need to be handled with tact and respect and no small degree of charm. Which is why you will leave the talking to me.”

[The Company walks across a bridge and enters Rivendell. A few elves are seen strolling about. Bilbo gazes in awe at the beauty of the place. The dwarves look uneasy.]



[A dark-haired elf walks down a flight of stairs and greets them.]

[Lindir:] “Mithrandir.”

[Gandalf:] “Ah, Lindir!”

[As Lindir and Gandalf greet each other, the dwarves murmur amongst themselves in distrust. Thorin whispers to Dwalin.]

[Thorin:] “Stay sharp.”

[Lindir]: “Lastannem i athrannedh i Vruinen.”  [subtitle: We heard you had crossed into the Valley.]

[Gandalf:] “I must speak with Lord Elrond.”

[Lindir:] “My lord Elrond is not here.”

[Gandalf:] “Not here? Where is he?”

[Suddenly, the Elvish horns from earlier are heard again. The Company turns around and they see a group of armed horsemen approaching along the bridge at a rapid rate.]

[Thorin:] “Ifridî bekâr!” [translated: Ready weapons!’] “Hold ranks!”

[The dwarves bunch up together into a tight circle with their weapons pointed outward; the mounted Elves arrive and ride in circles around the dwarves. Eventually, they stop, and one elf, Elrond, separates himself from the others.]

[Elrond:] “Gandalf.”

[Gandalf bows gracefully.]

[Gandalf:] “Lord Elrond. Mellonnen! Mo evínedh?” [subtitle: My friend! Where have you been?]

[Elrond:] “Farannem ‘lamhoth i udul o charad. Dagannem rim na Iant Vedui.”  [subtitle: We’ve been hunting a pack of Orcs that came up from the South. We slew a number near the Hidden Pass.]

[Elrond dismounts from his horse, then he and Gandalf hug.]

[Elrond:] “Strange for Orcs to come so close to our borders. Something, or someone, has drawn them near.”

[He holds up an Orc sword and shows it to everyone, then hands it to Lindir.]

[Gandalf:] “Ah, that may have been us.”

[Thorin steps forward, and Elrond looks upon him with recognition]

[Elrond:] “Welcome Thorin, son of Thrain.”

[Thorin:] “I do not believe we have met.”

[Elrond:] “You have your grandfather’s bearing. I knew Thror when he ruled under the Mountain.”

[Thorin:] “Indeed; he made no mention of you.”

[Ignoring this insult, Elrond turns to the dwarves and speaks in Elvish (Sindarin). The dwarves don’t understand what he is saying.]

[Elrond:] “Nartho i noer, toltho i viruvor. Boe i annam vann a nethail vin.” [no subtitles; translation is: Light the fires, bring forth the wine. We must feed our guests.]

[Gloin:] “What is he saying? Does he offer us insult?”

[The dwarves grow bellicose and grip their weapons uneasily. Gandalf speaks exasperatedly.]

[Gandalf:] “No, master Gloin, he’s offering you food.”

[The dwarves quickly discuss this amongst themselves.]

[Gloin:] “Ah well, in that case, lead on.”



[The dwarves are sitting around tables in the Elven court, eating. However, they are not very appreciative of the Elves’ vegetables.]

[Dori:] “Try it. Just a mouthful.”

[Ori:] “I don’t like green food.”

[Dwalin looks through a bowl of greens.]

[Dwalin:] “Where’s the meat?”

[Oin holds up a vegetable with his knife and looks at in disgust.]

[Ori:] “Have they got any chips?”

[An Elf maiden plays a harp in the background. Elrond and Gandalf walk through the halls of Rivendell.]

[Gandalf:] “Kind of you to invite us. I'm not really dressed for dinner.”

[Elrond:] “Well, you never are.”

[They both laugh, and they arrive at the courtyard where the dwarves are eating. An elf maiden plays a flute; Oin, not liking the sound, stuffs a napkin in his hearing trumpet, and looks happy that he can no longer hear the music.]



[Still at the feast, Elrond examines the swords Gandalf and Thorin found in the trolls’ hoard. He looks at Orcrist first.]



[Elrond:] “This is Orcrist, the Goblin Cleaver. A famous blade, forged by the High Elves of the West, my kin. May it serve you well.”

[He hands Orcrist back to Thorin, who accepts it with a nod. Elrond then examines Glamdring.]

[Elrond:] “And this is Glamdring, the Foe-hammer, sword of the King of Gondolin. These swords were made for the goblin wars of the First Age...”

[Elrond’s voice fades on the soundtrack, as Bilbo pulls out his sword and looks at it.]

[Balin:] “I wouldn’t bother, laddie. Swords are named for the great deeds they do in war.”

[Bilbo:] “What are you saying, my sword hasn’t seen battle?”

[Balin:] “I’m not actually sure it is a sword; more of a letter opener, really.”

[Elrond:] “How did you come by these?”

[Gandalf:] “We found them in a troll hoard on the Great East Road, shortly before we were ambushed by orcs.”

[Elrond:] “And what were you doing on the Great East Road?”

[No one answers; Thorin looks perturbed.]



[It is night. Gandalf, Elrond, Thorin, Balin, and Bilbo are standing in a hall in Rivendell.]

[Thorin:] “Our business is no concern of elves.”

[Gandalf:] “For goodness sake, Thorin, show him the map.”

[Thorin:] “It is the legacy of my people; it is mine to protect, as are its secrets.”

[Gandalf:] “Save me from the stubbornness of Dwarves. Your pride will be your downfall. You stand here in the presence of one of the few in Middle-earth who can read that map. Show it to Lord Elrond.”

[Thorin thinks quietly for a few seconds, with everyone looking at him. He begins to hand the map to Elrond, and Balin tries to stop him.]

[Balin:] “Thorin, no!”

[Thorin brushes Balin aside and hands Elrond the map. Elrond looks at it.]



[Elrond:] “Erebor. What is your interest in this map?”

[Thorin is about to speak, but Gandalf interrupts him.]

[Gandalf:] “It’s mainly academic. As you know, this sort of artifact sometimes contains hidden text. You still read Ancient Dwarvish, do you not?”

[Elrond walks a little bit away, looking at the map. As the moonlight hits the map, Elrond realizes something.]

[Elrond:] “Cirth Ithil.”

[Gandalf:] “Moon runes. Of course. An easy thing to miss.”

[Elrond:] “Well in this case, that is true; moon runes can only be read by the light of a moon of the same shape and season as the day on which they were written.”

[Thorin:] “Can you read them?”

[Elrond leads them all to an open area outside, on the side of a cliff, with waterfalls all around. The moon is behind some clouds. They walk toward a large crystalline table.]

[Elrond:] “These runes were written on a Midsummer’s Eve by the light of a crescent moon nearly two hundred years ago. It would seem you were meant to come to Rivendell. Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield; the same moon shines upon us tonight.”

[As they look up, the clouds covering the moon float away, and rays of moonlight hits the crystalline table, causing light to flow through the map which has been laid on the table. Ancient runes become visible on the map, and Elrond translates them out loud.]

[Elrond:] “Stand by the gray stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the keyhole.”

[Bilbo:] “Durin’s Day?”

[Gandalf:] “It is the start of the dwarves’ new year, when the last moon of autumn and the first sun of winter appear in the sky together.”

[Thorin:] “This is ill news. Summer is passing. Durin’s Day will soon be upon us.”

[Balin:] “We still have time.”

[Bilbo:] “Time? For what?”

[Balin:] “To find the entrance. We have to be standing at exactly the right spot at exactly the right time. Then, and only then, can the door be opened.”

[Elrond:] “So this is your purpose, to enter the Mountain.”



[Thorin:] “What of it?”

[Elrond:] “There are some who would not deem it wise.”

[Thorin takes back the map gruffly.]

[Gandalf:] “Who do you mean?”

[Elrond:] “You are not the only guardian to stand watch over Middle-earth.”

[As Elrond walks away, Gandalf turns slowly, thinking deeply.]



[It is late at night. Wargs howl. Yazneg and his Warg Scouts and Wargs step into the ruin on Weathertop, where many other Wargs and Orcs are gathered. A large, white Warg growls at him. Behind the White Warg is a tall, pale Orc, facing away. It is Azog.]

[Yazneg:] “Khozdayin… Dorguz… zuranimid.” [subtitle: The Dwarves, Master... we lost them.] “Shugi golgai gelnakhanishim--”  [subtitle: Ambushed by Elvish filth, we were--]

[Azog:] “Sha nargiz ob-hakhtil…” [subtitle: I don’t want excuses...] “Nargiz khobdi Rani Khozdil!”  [subtitle: I want the head of the Dwarf King!] 

[Azog turns around and approaches Yazneg. His left arm, which Thorin Oakenshield cut off long ago during the battle of Azanulbizar, has been replaced with a metal arm and claw.]	

[Yazneg:] “Murganish dum…Turim hag shad.” [subtitle: We were outnumbered...there was nothing we could do.] “Zorzor go-kairaz obguraniz.” [subtitle: I barely escaped with my life.]

[Azog:] “Ki go-kairag baganig.” [subtitle: Far better you had paid with it.]

[Azog strokes Yazneg’s head with his right hand, then grabs and lifts Yazneg by the throat with his metal left hand. With a roar, Azog throws him against the pillars to the side. Wargs attack Yazneg, killing him and eating him. Yazneg’s fellow Rider quakes in fear at the sight; however, the White Warg and Azog are unfazed.]

[Azog:] “Khozd-shrakhun gud sha kilyash-zag.”  [subtitle: The Dwarf-scum will show themselves soon enough.] “Zidgar obod tung nash ru khobdud!”  [subtitle: Send out word, there is a price on their heads!]

[The rest of the Orcs leap on their Wargs; they all run off from Weathertop to do Azog’s will.]



[Back in Rivendell, the Dwarves are having a late-night party in their quarters. They roast sausages over a fire made by burning the Elvish furniture. Bofur, seeing a heavy Bombur sitting on a bench and eating a large bowl of food, looks at his sausage thoughtfully.]

[Bofur:] “Bombur!”

[As Bombur looks up, Bofur throws him the sausage. Bombur catches it; the weight of the sausage is just too much for the bench, and the bench breaks; Bombur, shrieking, falls to the floor, along with all his food. The dwarves laugh uproariously.]

[Gandalf and Elrond walk up a flight of stairs and into a pavilion.]

[Gandalf:] “With or without our help, these dwarves will march on the mountain. They are determined to reclaim their homeland. I do not believe Thorin Oakenshield feels that he’s answerable to anyone. Nor for that matter am I.”   

[Elrond:] “It is not me you must answer to.”



[Gandalf looks and sees a tall, beautiful, female Elf standing framed against the moonlight. She slowly turns around. It is Galadriel.]



[Gandalf:] “Lady Galadriel.”

[Galadriel:] “Mithrandir. It has been a long time.”

[Gandalf:] “Nae nin gwistant infanneth, mal ú-eichia i Chíril Lorien.” [subtitle: ‘Age may have changed me, but not so the Lady of Lorien.]

[Galadriel smiles.]

[Gandalf:] “I had no idea Lord Elrond had sent for you.”

[A voice sounds out of the darkness.]

[Saruman:] “He didn’t. I did.”

[Gandalf turns and sees Saruman the White; he bows to him.]

[Gandalf:] “Saruman.”

[Saruman:] “You’ve been busy of late, my friend.”



[The White Council, composed of Saruman, Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf, are in the pavilion. Gandalf and Saruman sit at a table; Elrond and Galadriel stand or walk about. Dawn is slowly breaking.]



[Saruman:] “Tell me, Gandalf, did you think these plans and schemes of yours would go unnoticed?”

[Gandalf:] “Unnoticed? No, I’m simply doing what I feel to be right.”

[Galadriel:] “The dragon has long been on your mind.”

[Gandalf:] “This is true, my lady. Smaug owes allegiance to no one. But if he should side with the enemy, a dragon could be used to terrible effect.”

[Saruman:] “What enemy? Gandalf, the enemy is defeated. Sauron is vanquished. He can never regain his full strength.”

[Elrond:] “Gandalf, for four hundred years, we have lived in peace. A hard-won, watchful peace.”

[Gandalf:] “Are we? Are we at peace? Trolls have come down from the mountains. They are raiding villages, destroying farms. Orcs have attacked us on the road.”

[Elrond:] “Hardly a prelude to war.”

[Saruman:] “Always you must meddle, looking for trouble where none exists.”

[Galadriel:] “Let him speak.”

[Gandalf:] “There is something at work beyond the evil of Smaug. Something far more powerful. We can remain blind, but it will not be ignoring us, that I can promise you. A sickness lies over the Greenwood. The woodsmen who live there now call it ‘Mirkwood’. and they say...”

[Saruman:] “Well, don’t stop now. Tell us about the woodsmen say.”

[Gandalf:] “They speak of a Necromancer living in Dol Guldur, a sorcerer who can summon the dead.”

[Saruman:] “That’s absurd. No such power exists in the world. This...Necromancer is nothing more than a mortal man. A conjurer dabbling in black magic.”

[Gandalf:] “And so I thought too. But, Radagast has seen--”

[Saruman:] “Radagast? Do not speak to me about Radagast the Brown. He is a foolish fellow.”

[Gandalf:] “Well, he’s odd, I grant you. He lives a solitary life.”

[Saruman:] “It’s not that. It’s his excessive consumption of mushrooms. They’ve addled his brain and yellowed his teeth. I warned him, it is unbefitting of the Istari to be wander in the woods...”

[Saruman’s voice fades away as Galadriel focuses on Gandalf, and speaks to him in his mind.]

[Galadriel, telepathically:] “You carry something. It came to you from Radagast. He found it in Dol Guldur.”

[Gandalf, telepathically:] “Yes.”

[Galadriel, telepathically:] “Show me.”

[Gandalf lifts Radagast’s package, which he had in his lap, and places it on the table. It lets out a dull thud.]

[Saruman:] “…or I’d think I was talking to myself…”

[Elrond:] “What is that?”

[Galadriel:] “A relic of Mordor.”

[Elrond, who was reaching out to unwrap the package, draws his hand back. He then reaches for it again and opens it, revealing the sword Radagast took from the spirit in Dol Guldur. The White Council members look upon it in shock.]

[Elrond:] “A Morgul blade.”

[Galadriel:] “Made for the Witch-king of Angmar, and buried with him. When Angmar fell, men of the North took his body and all that he possessed and sealed it within the High-Fells of Rhudaur. Deep within the rock they buried them, in a tomb so dark it would never come to light.”

[Elrond:] “This is not possible. A powerful spells lies upon those tombs; they cannot be opened.”

[Saruman:] “What proof do we have this weapon came from Angmar’s grave?”

[Gandalf:] “I have none.”

[Saruman:] “Because there is none. Let us examine what we know. A single Orc pack has dared to cross the Bruinen. A dagger from a bygone age has been found. And a human sorcerer, who calls himself the Necromancer, has taken up residence in a ruined fortress. It’s not so very much, after all. The question of this dwarvish company, however, troubles me deeply. I’m not convinced, Gandalf; I do not feel I can condone such a quest. If they’d come to me, I might have spared them this disappointment. I do not pretend to understand your reasons for raising their hopes…” 

[Saruman’s voice fades away as Galadriel again focuses on Gandalf. She speaks to him telepathically.]

[Galadriel, telepathically:] “They are leaving.”

[Gandalf, telepathically:] “Yes.”

[Galadriel, telepathically:] “You knew.”

[Saruman:] “…I am afraid there is nothing else for it.” 

[Gandalf nods. Galadriel smiles slightly. A step is heard, and they all turn around; Lindir come up and bows.]

[Lindir:] “My Lord Elrond; the dwarves, they’ve gone.”



[It is morning; the dwarves are hiking along the path away from Rivendell.]

[Thorin:] “Be on your guard; we’re about to step over the edge of the Wild. Balin, you know these paths; lead on.”

[Balin:] “Aye.”

[Bilbo turns around and looks back at Rivendell, longingly.]

[Thorin:] “Master Baggins, I suggest you keep up.”

[The dwarves and Bilbo continue on their journey.]





[Back in Rivendell, Gandalf and Galadriel are the only ones remaining in the pavilion.]

[Galadriel:] “You will follow them?”

[Gandalf:] “Yes.”

[Galadriel:] “You are right to help Thorin Oakenshield. But I fear this quest has set in motion forces we do not yet understand. The riddle of the Morgul blade must be answered. Something moves in the shadows, unseen, hidden from our sight. It will not show itself, not yet. But every day it grows in strength. You must be careful.”

[Gandalf:] “Yes.”

[Gandalf turns and starts walking away. When he has gone a short distance, Galadriel speaks again.]

[Galadriel:] “Mithrandir? Why the Halfling?”



[Gandalf:] “I don’t know. Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that is not what I have found. I’ve found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk, that keeps the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.”

[Galadriel suddenly appears in front of Gandalf, and she takes his old, weary hands in hers.]

[Galadriel, telepathically:] “Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.”

[Galadriel, aloud:] “You are not alone.”

[Galadriel tucks a loose strand of Gandalf’s hair back.]

[Galadriel:] “Ae boe i le eliathon, im tulithon.”  [subtitle: If you should ever need my help, I will come.]

[Gandalf bows, and Galadriel gently moves her hands away from his. Gandalf looks up, and Galadriel has disappeared.]



[Many scenic shots of the Dwarves and Bilbo hiking through the wilderness of Middle-earth, over ranges, mountains, and plains.]
[They are crossing the Misty Mountains; the trail is narrow and dangerous, with a cliff on one side and a sheer drop on the other. There is a fierce storm in the air, with lightning and rain all around.]

[Thorin:] “Hold on!”

[As Bilbo walks, the stone beneath his feet gives away, and he starts falling into the chasm; Dwalin manages to pull him back in time.]

[Thorin:] “We must find shelter!”

[Dwalin:] “Watch out!”

[The Dwarves look up and see a massive boulder hurtling through the air; it hits the mountainside above them, causing rocks to fall all around them as they press themselves against the mountain.]

[Balin:] “This is no thunderstorm; it’s a thunder battle! Look!”

[A stone giant rears up from a nearby mountain; it rips off a massive boulder from the top of the mountain.]

[Bofur:] “Well bless me, the legends are true. Giants; Stone Giants!”



[Thorin:] “Take cover: you’ll fall!”

[Kili:] “What’s happening?”

[Giant #1 throws the boulder far in the air; another stone giant, #2, appears from behind the Company, and it is hit in the head. The dwarves yell at each other to brace and hold on, and the rocks beneath their feet begin to give way from all the vibrations and from the impact of the falling rocks. The ground between some of the Company members splits; part of the group is on one side, and part on the other.]

[Fili:] "Kili! Grab my hand! Ki..."

[As the two stone giants fight with their fists, the dwarves hold on tight as they are flung around. One of the groups manages to jump to a different spot. A third stone giant appears, and it throws a boulder at the head of one of the first two. That one falls over; as the first group watches, it appears to them that the other group of the Company has been smashed to bits. The hurt stone giant loses its footing and falls down the chasm.]

[Thorin:] “No! No! Kili!”

[The group rushes to the spot where the others appeared to have been crushed, but they are safe.]

[Balin:] “We’re all right! We’re alive!” 

[Bofur:] “Where’s Bilbo? Where’s the Hobbit?”

[Ori:] “There!”
 
[Dwalin:] “Get him!”

[Bilbo is seen hanging onto the edge of the cliff with just his fingertips. Ori dives onto the ground and tries to grab Bilbo’s arm, but Bilbo slips and falls another few feet before he catches another handhold. As the dwarves try to pull him up unsuccessfully, Thorin swings down on the cliff next to Bilbo and boost him up, where the others pull him to safety. Dwalin tries to lift Thorin back up too, but Thorin loses his grip and begins falling too; however, Dwalin, with much effort, is able to pull him back up.]

[Dwalin:] “I thought we’d lost our burglar.”


[Thorin:] “He’s been lost ever since he left home. He should never have come. He has no place amongst us. Dwalin!”

[They go off and find a cave.]

[Dwalin:] “It looks safe enough.”

[Thorin:] “Search to the back; caves in mountains are seldom unoccupied.”

[Dwalin searches the cave with a lantern.]

[Dwalin:] “There’s nothing here.”

[Gloin drops a bundle of wood on the floor and rubs his hands.]

[Gloin:] “Right then! Let’s get a fire started.”

[Thorin:] “No, No fires, not in this place. Get some sleep. We start at first light.”

[Balin:] “We were to wait in the mountains until Gandalf joined us. That was the plan.”

[Thorin:] “Plans change. Bofur, take the first watch.”



[Outside, in the valleys before the Misty Mountains, the White Warg sniffs the ground; Azog is on its back. He speaks in the Black Speech; the translated meaning is:]

[Azog:] [subtitle: The scent is fresh! They have taken the mountain pass.]

[He and the rest of the Warg Scouts race off after the dwarves.]



[The Company is resting in the cave; all the dwarves are asleep. Bilbo, only pretending to be asleep, stealthily opens his eyes and looks around. Seeing that no one is watching, he quietly rolls up his blankets and packs his things. Grabbing his walking stick, he starts to leave the cave, tiptoeing over the sleeping dwarves.]



[Bofur, who is standing watch, sees Bilbo trying to leave. He jumps up and tries to stop him. They whisper so as not to wake the others.]

[Bofur:] “Where do you think you’re going?”

[Bilbo:] “Back to Rivendell.”

[Bofur:] “No, no, you can’t turn back now, you’re part of the Company. You’re one of us.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not though, am I? Thorin said I should never have come, and he was right. I’m not a Took, I’m a Baggins, I don’t know what I was thinking. I should never have run out my door.”

[Thorin, who is awake, stares thoughtfully at the wall as he listens.]

[Bofur:] “You’re homesick; I understand.”

[Bilbo:] “No, you don’t, you don’t understand! None of you do - you’re dwarves. You used to - to this life, to living on the road, never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere.”

[Bofur looks offended, and Bilbo is repentant.]

[Bilbo:] “I am sorry, I didn’t...”

[Thorin listens on.]

[Bofur:] “No, you’re right. We don’t belong anywhere. I wish you all the luck in the world. I really do.

[Bofur smiles and places his hand on Bilbo’s shoulder; Bilbo soon turns and begins to walk away.]

[Bofur:] “What’s that?”

[Something is glowing; Bilbo pull his sword partway out of its sheath and sees that it is growing bright blue, meaning Orcs are nearby. Thorin raises his head as he hears strange machinery noises and sees cracks form in the sand on the floor of the cave.”]

[Thorin:] “Wake up. Wake up!”

[Before anyone can react, the floor of the cave collapses downwards; the floor is really a giant trap door. The entire Company falls down a chute, slides through a tunnel, and lands in a giant wooden cage. As they struggle to get up, a horde of goblins attacks them, takes away their weapons, and drags them all away. As the dwarves are lead away kicking and yelling, Bilbo somehow gets missed by the goblins; not seeing him they leave him behind. Nori, looking over his shoulder, sees this happen. Bilbo scampers behind some railing to hide as he watches the goblins proceed through the tunnels. Bats fly in the darkness. Bilbo draws his sword, which is glowing bright blue, and slowly follows the goblins. Suddenly, one goblin jumps out in front of him and rushes at him with his sword. After a brief fight in which Bilbo barely manages to keep himself alive, the goblin and Bilbo both fall over the edge of a platform and fall through the darkness.]

[Meanwhile, the goblin horde brings the dwarves through a vast network of tunnels and wooden bridges to the throne room and platform of the Great Goblin. The Great Goblin is a massive Goblin sitting on a throne, holding a mace topped with a skull. He is far larger than any other goblin, and he is incredibly ugly, with warts all over her swinging chin. The dwarves’ weapons are piled together. The Great Goblin jumps off his throne, trampling several goblins, and approaches the Company.]



[Great Goblin:] “Who would be so bold as to come armed into my kingdom? Spies? Thieves? Assassins?”

[Grinnah:] “Dwarves, Your Malevolence.”

[Great Goblin:] “Dwarves?”

[Grinnah:] “We found them on the front porch.”

[Great Goblin:] “Well, don’t just stand there; search them! Every crack, every crevice.”

[The goblins search the dwarves thoroughly, throwing away whatever they find. Oin’s hearing trumpet is thrown on the floor and crushed underfoot.]

[Great Goblin:] “What are you doing in these parts? Speak!”

[None of the dwarves respond.]

[Great Goblin:] “Well then, if they will not talk, we’ll make them squawk! Bring out the Mangler! Bring out the Bone Breaker! Start with the youngest.”

[The Great Goblin points at Ori. However, Thorin steps forward.]

[Thorin:] “Wait.”

[Great Goblin:] “Well, well, well, look who it is. Thorin son of Thrain, son of Thror; King under the Mountain.”

[The Great Goblin bows exaggeratedly to Thorin.]

[Great Goblin:] “Oh, but I’m forgetting, you don’t have a mountain. And you’re not a king. Which makes you nobody, really. I know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head. Just the head, nothing attached. Perhaps you know of whom I speak, an old enemy of yours. A Pale Orc astride a White Warg.”

[Thorin looks up in surprise and disbelief.]

[Thorin:] “Azog the Defiler was destroyed. He was slain in battle long ago.”

[Great Goblin:] “So you think his defiling days are done, do you?”

[The Great Goblin laughs, then turns to a tiny goblin sitting in a basket and holding a slate.]

[Great Goblin:] “Send word to the Pale Orc; tell him I have found his prize.”

[The tiny goblin writes down the message on his slate; cackling, he then pulls a lever, causing his basket to start sliding down a system of ropes and pulleys into the darkness.]



[Bilbo regains consciousness and finds himself in a dark cavern, lying behind a clump of mushrooms.  He sees the goblin who attacked him lying nearby, nearly dead. Suddenly, Bilbo sees a strange figure approaching the goblin. It is Gollum.]

[Gollum:] “Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes! Gollum. Gollum.”

[Bilbo, out of sight behind the mushrooms, watches as Gollum circles around the goblin. Gollum then begins pulling the goblin away by the feet. Suddenly, the goblin wakes up and begins flailing around. In a fit of rage, Gollum grabs a rock and pounds the goblin on the head with it, knocking it unconscious again. As Bilbo watches in horror, a golden ring falls out of Gollum’s loincloth and falls on the floor. Gollum resumes pulling the unconscious goblin away.]

[Gollum:] “Nasty goblinses. Better than old bones, Precious; better than nothing.”

[Bilbo, emerging from his hiding spot and retrieving his sword, follows after Gollum. By the light of the sword, he sees the Ring on the ground and he picks it up, examining it.]



[Hearing Gollum singing in the distance, Bilbo puts the Ring into his pocket and follows the sound of Gollum’s voice.]

[Smeagol:] “Too many boneses, Precious! Nothing of flesh!”

[Gollum:] “Shut up! Get its skin off. Start with its head.”

[Smeagol, singing:] “The cold hard lands, they bites our hands, they gnaws our feet. The rocks and stones, they’re like old bones, all bare of meat. Cold as death, they have no breath, it’s good to eat!”

[Rounding a corner, Bilbo sees Gollum silhouetted on top of a rock in the middle of a small lake. Gollum is singing as he beats the goblin’s body. He smashes it in the head again with a rock. Seeing the glow of Bilbo’s sword, Gollum looks up. Bilbo quickly hides behind a rock, realizing that his sword is still glowing brightly. However, the sword’s light starts flickering, then completely dies out, signifying that the goblin is dead. Bilbo peeks out from behind the rock, then is shocked to see that Gollum is no longer there. Gollum stealthily paddles through the lake in his little boat, using his hands as paddles. Bilbo slowly looks up and finds Gollum on a rock above him; Gollum jumps down in front of Bilbo.]

[Gollum:] “Bless us  and splash us, Precious! That’s a meaty mouthful.”

[Gollum approaches Bilbo, but Bilbo places the point of his sword on Gollum’s throat, causing Gollum to retreat in fear.]

[Gollum:] “Aaahh. Gollum. Gollum. Ack”

[Bilbo:] “Back. Stay back. I’m warning you, don’t come any closer.”

[Gollum:] “It’s got an elfish blade, but it’s not an Elfs. Not an Elfs, no. What is it, Precious? What is it?”

[Bilbo:] “My name is Bilbo Baggins.”

[Gollum:] “Bagginses? What is a Bagginses, Precious?”

[Bilbo:] “I’m a Hobbit from the Shire.”

[Gollum:] “Oh! We like Goblinses, batses, and fishes, but we hasn’t tried Hobbitses before. Is it soft? Is it juicy?”

[As Gollum approaches again, Bilbo holds out his sword in front of him and wildly waves it about.]

[Bilbo:] “Now, now, K--keep your distance! I’ll use this if I have to!”

[Gollum snarls at Bilbo, causing Bilbo to step back.]

[Bilbo:] “I don’t want any trouble, do you understand? Just show me the way to get out of here, and I’ll be on my way.”

[Gollum:] “Why, is it lost?”

[Bilbo:] “Yes, yes, and I want to get unlost as soon as possible.”

[Upon hearing this, Gollum answers in a different voice than before; this is his Smeagol personality speaking.]

[Gollum:] “Ooh! We knows! We knows safe paths for Hobbitses. Safe paths in the dark.”

[The Gollum side suddenly takes over the Smeagol side; this exchange of control happens several more times in the rest of Bilbo and Gollum’s conversation.]

[Gollum:] “Shut up.”

[Bilbo:] “I didn’t say anything.”

[Gollum:] “Wasn’t talking to you.”

[Gollum:] “But yes, we was, Precious, we was.”

[Bilbo:] “Look, uh, I don’t know what your game is, but I--”

[Gollum:] “Games? We love games, doesn’t we, Precious? Does it like games? Does it? Does it? Does it like to play?”

[Bilbo:] “Maybe?”

[Smeagol holds up his hands, then begins reciting a riddle.]

[Gollum:] “What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than trees. Up, up, up it goes, and yet, never grows.”

[Bilbo:] “...The mountain.”

[Smeagol begins laughing uproariously.]

[Gollum:] “Yess, yess, oh, let’s have another one, eh? Yes, come on, do it again, do it—do it again. Ask us.”

[Gollum:] “No! No more riddles. Finish him off. Finish him now. Gollum! Gollum!”

[Gollum snarls, and begins rushing at Bilbo to kill him, but Bilbo holds out his hand to stop him and begins speaking.]

[Bilbo:] “No! No, no, no. I wa—I want to play. I do. I want to play. I can see you are very good at this. S—so why don’t we have a game of riddles? Yes, just, just you and me.”

[Bilbo crouches until he is level with Gollum; Gollum scuttles forward, close to Bilbo, whispering excitedly.]

[Gollum:] “Yes! Yes, just, just—just us.”

[Bilbo:] “Yes. Yes. And—and if I win, you show me the way out.”

[Gollum:] “Yes. Yes -”

[Gollum takes over and snarls, turning away from Bilbo. Gollum’s two personality’s talk to each other.]

[Gollum:] “And if it loses? What then?”

[Gollum:] “Well, if it loses, Precious, we will eats it!”

[Gollum laughs to himself, then turns back to Bilbo]

[Gollum:] “If Baggins loses, we eats it whole.”



[There is a pause for several seconds as Bilbo digests this new information.]

[Bilbo:] “Fair enough.”

[Bilbo stands up and puts his sword away as Gollum looks on interestedly.]

[Gollum:] “Well, Baggins first.”

[As Bilbo thinks of a riddle, Gollum rests his hands and chin on the edge of a rock.]

[Bilbo:] “Thirty white horses on a red hill. First they champ, then they stamp, then they stand still.”

[As Gollum thinks, he keeps opening his eyes and mouth as if he knows the answer, then changes his mind. This goes on for several seconds, until he finally replies questioningly.]

[Gollum:] “Teeth?”

[Bilbo looks unhappy, as the answer is correct. Gollum becomes ecstatic and laughs throatily.]

[Gollum:] “Teeth!! Yes, my Precious. But we—we—we only have nine.”

[Gollum displays his mouth, showing that he really does only have nine teeth. Bilbo is disgusted. Gollum begins reciting his next riddle, while getting closer and closer to Bibo. Bilbo keeps a large rock between the two of them.]

[Gollum:] “Our turn. Voiceless it cries, wingless flutters, toothless bites, mouthless mutters.”

[Bilbo:] “Just a minute.”

[As Bilbo walks off thinking, Gollum’s evil face turns into Smeagol’s excited face]

[Gollum:] “Oh, oh! We knows. We knows!”

[Gollum:] “Shut up.”

[As Bilbo observes the water, he notices tiny waves forming as a breeze ruffles the surface of the water.]

[Bilbo:] “Wind. It’s wind! Of course it is.”

[Gollum snarls in frustration and begins slinking around, approaching Bilbo.]

[Gollum:] “Very clever, Hobbitses, very clever.”

[As he gets too close for comfort, Bilbo pulls out his sword and points it at Gollum again, but also begins saying his own riddle.]

[Bilbo:] “Ah, ah, ah, ah. A—a box without hinges, key, o—or, or lid; yet golden treasure inside is hid.”

[Gollum thinks hard, talking to himself and making many hand motions.]

[Gollum:] “A box...and a lid...and then a key....

[Bilbo:] “Well?”

[Gollum:] “It’s nasty. Uh, box, uh...”

[Bilbo:] “Give up?”

[Gollum:] “Give us a chance, Precious, give us a chance!”

[In frustration, Smeagol begins pounding the floor and snarling. He puckers his face up deeply, then suddenly opens his eyes wide as he gets the answer.]

[Gollum:] “Eggses! Eggses! [He laughs.] What crunchy little eggses, yes. Grandmother taught us to suck them, yes.”

[As Smeagol laughs, a bat makes a noise in the darkness. Bilbo turns to look for the source of the noise; as he turns back around, he realizes that Gollum is gone. Gollum’s voice suddenly starts sounding like an echo from different parts of the cave. Gollum speaks his riddle from some unknown spot.]

[Gollum:] “Ahh. We have one for you: All things it devours, birds, beasts, trees, flowers. Gnaws iron, bites steel, grinds hard stones to meal. Answer us.”

[Bilbo:] “Give me a moment, please, I gave you a good long while.”

[Bilbo tries to think while at the same time he walks around with his sword drawn, looking for Gollum,.]

[Bilbo:] “I don’t know this one.”

[Gollum:] “Is it tasty? Is it scrumptious? Is it crunchable?”

[As Gollum says ‘crunchable,’ he appears behind Bilbo and tries to grab him by the throat, but Bilbo jumps away and points his sword at Gollum.]

[Bilbo:] “Let me think. Let me think.”

[Gollum:] “It’s stuck. Bagginses is stuck.”

[Bilbo paces back and forth next to the water, thinking. Gollum smiles eerily and puts up his hands in a shrug.]

[Gollum:] “Time’s up.”

[Gollum shifts, preparing to leap on Bilbo.]

[Bilbo:] “Time. Ti—the answer is time.”

[Gollum snarls in frustration.]

[Bilbo:] “Actually, it wasn’t that hard.”

[Gollum:] “Last question. Last chance.” 

[Bilbo:] “Ah, uh....”

[Gollum:] “Ask us. ASK US!!”

[Although Gollum is smiling sweetly, he has a rock clutched behind his back with which to hit Bilbo. The first time he says “Ask us,” he says it sweetly. He then roars it a second time angrily.]

[Bilbo:] “Yes, yes, alright.”

[Bilbo strolls to the edge of the lake to think. He absentmindedly rubs his pocket and feels the ring inside.]

[Bilbo:] “What have I got in my pocket?”

[Gollum looks disgusted and angry.]

[Gollum:] “That’s not fair. It’s not fair! It’s against the rules!”

[In frustration, Gollum throws down the rock he’d been clutching. Bilbo makes a startled noise.]

[Gollum:] “Ask us another one.”

[Bilbo:] “No, no, no, no. You said ‘Ask me a question.’ Well, that is my question. What have I got in my pocket?”

[Gollum jumps off his rock and approaches Bilbo; Bilbo moves to keep a rock between him and Gollum.]

[Gollum:] “Three guesses, Precious. It must give us three.”

[Gollum holds up two fingers to quantify three.]

[Bilbo:] “Three guesses. Very well, guess away.”

[Gollum:] “Handses!”

[Bilbo pulls his hand out of his pocket just in time.]

[Bilbo:] “Wrong, guess again.”

[Gollum crouches on the floor, trying to think of the answer. He mutters potential answers to himself and slaps the floor in increasing anger and ferocity as he fails to come up with the right answer.]

[Gollum:] “Fish-bones, goblins’ teeth, wet shells, bat’s wings ... Knife!”

[Gollum:] “Oh, shut up.”

[Bilbo:] “Wrong again. Last guess.”

[Gollum:] “String!”

[Gollum:] “Or nothing.”

[Bilbo:] “Two guesses at once; wrong both times.”

[Upon hearing this, Gollum falls to the floor, sobbing.]

[Bilbo:] “So, come then, I won the game, you promised to show me the way out.”

[Gollum:] “Did we say so, Precious? Did we say so?”

[Gollum slowly turns around and glares hatefully at Bilbo.]

[Gollum:] “What has it got in its pocketses?”

[Bilbo points his sword at Gollum.]

[Bilbo:] “That’s no concern of yours. You lost.”

[Gollum:] “Lost? Lost? Lost?”

[Gollum grins as he slowly approaches Bilbo, planning to kill him. He reaches for something hidden at his side; realizing that the item is not there, his face registers his shock. He begins groping all over himself trying to find it.]

[Gollum:] “Where is it? Where is it? No! Ahh! Where is it? No! No!!!”

[Gollum scuttles around the cave, scattering bones and rocks as he searches in vain for the Ring. He even splashes through the shallows of the lake. His voice breaks as he cries.]

[Gollum:] “Lost! Curses and splashes, my precious is lost!”

[While Gollum’s back is toward him, Bilbo, realizing what it was that Gollum lost, quickly takes the Ring from his pocket and holds it in his hand behind his back.]

[Bilbo:] “What have you lost?”

[Gollum:] “Mustn't ask us! Not its business! No! Gollum, Gollum.”

[Gollum, leaning over the edge of the lake, sobs quietly. As he stares into the water, his sobs cease and his face becomes contorted in anger.]

[Gollum:] “What has it got in its nasty little pocketses?”

[In fear, Bilbo clutches the Ring behind him more tightly and points his sword at Gollum. Gollum slowly looks up in shock and anger. At first, he whispers; he then gets louder and louder until he is roaring.]



[Gollum:] “He stole it. He stole it! Ahh! HE STOLE IT!”

[Snarling, Gollum throws a stone at Bilbo. Bilbo deflects it with his sword, then runs away, with Gollum chasing him.]



[Back in the throneroom of the Great Goblin, dozens of goblins carry massive instruments of torture on their shoulders, bringing them to the Great Goblin. Meanwhile, the Great Goblin is dancing and singing lustily.]

[Great Goblin:] “Bones will be shattered, necks will be wrung! You’ll be beaten and battered, from racks you’ll be hung. You will lie down here and never be found, down in the deep of Goblin-town.”

[Grinnah, one of the goblins, is examining the weapons the dwarves brought with them. He picks up Thorin’s sword, Orcrist, and slides it a few inches out of its sheath. Recognizing the sword, he gasps in horror and throws down the sword. It lands in view of all the goblins. Recognizing it, the goblins howl in fear and rage as they retreat from it; the Great Goblin runs rapidly to his throne, trampling many goblins on his way. He speaks loudly, pointing at the sword.]

[Great Goblin:] “I know that sword! It is the Goblin-Cleaver, the Biter, the blade that sliced a thousand necks.”

[As he speaks, Grinnah and the rest of the Goblins begin whipping the dwarves with ropes and leaping upon them, biting and slashing.]

[Great Goblin:] “Slash them! Beat them! Kill them! Kill them all! Cut off his head!”

[Goblins hold Thorin down, and one of them pulls out his knife and prepares to behead Thorin.]



[Suddenly, there is a massive explosion of bright light; the sound goes muted as a shockwave rips through the area, flinging goblins in the air and destroying the torturing machines. Everyone is knocked down, including the Great Goblin. When the force of the explosion has passed, most of the lights in the area have been snuffed out; in the background, a shadow with a tall pointy hat walks up. It is Gandalf, holding his staff and his sword, Glamdring. Light slowly returns to the area as the goblins and the dwarves slowly look up, recovering from the shock. They all stare at Gandalf.]

[Gandalf:] “Take up arms. Fight. Fight!”

[The dwarves quickly get up and begin fighting the goblins. As goblins run at Gandalf, he kills them with his sword and staff. The Great Goblin, still lying on the ground, sees Gandalf’s sword and points at it, crying aloud to his goblins.]

[Great Goblin:] “He wields the Foe-Hammer, the Beater, bright as daylight!”

[Some of the dwarves reach their pile of weapons and begin tossing the weapons to each other; they use their weapons to defeat the goblins around them. Oin manages to reclaim his hearing trumpet, although it has been quite flattened. Nori, while fighting, lands on the floor; the Great Goblin runs at him and swings his mace.]

[Dwarf:] “Nori!”

[Thorin jumps forward and deflects the Great Goblin’s blow, causing the Great Goblin to stumble backward and fall off the edge of his platform, falling to the depths below. The rest of the dwarves and Gandalf continue to fight.]

[Gandalf:] “Follow me. Quick! Run!”

[Cutting down the goblins around them, the dwarves and Gandalf run along a pathway leading away from the throne room.]



[Bilbo hurries through a cave, fleeing from Gollum, whom we can hear in the distance.]

[Gollum:] “Give it to us!”

[Bilbo is in a side cave; he sees Gollum running past the entrance of the cave he is in. Gasping, he turns around and tries to run through a crack in the wall. However, he gets stuck partway through. He looks up in fear as Gollum, attracted by the noise, backtracks and sees Bilbo stuck in the crack. Snarling, Gollum approaches Bilbo.]

[Gollum:] “It’s ours. It’s ours!”

[Gollum snarls again; Bilbo exhales and pushes as hard as he can; he manages to slip through the crack, but his waistcoat buttons are ripped off in the process and they hit Gollum in the face. Gollum snarls. On the other side of the crack, Bilbo falls down from his exertions. As he hits the ground, the Ring, which was in his hand, flies into the air. As it descends, Bilbo reaches up to grab it; instead of landing in his hand, however, the Ring slides onto his finger, and Bilbo suddenly becomes invisible. Gollum jumps into the area where Bilbo is, growling, and looks around for Bilbo; however, since Bilbo is invisible, he doesn’t see him, and Gollum continues down the cave. Bilbo, with the Ring on, sees everything as if he’s in a different reality. All the colors are muted, and the edges of everything are blurred and wavy.]

[Gollum:] “Thief! Baggins!”

[Seeing Gollum run away, Bilbo slowly stands up in shock.]



[Gandalf and the dwarves are running through the suspended passageways of Goblin Town, with hundreds of goblins running after them.]

[Gandalf:] “Quickly!”

[A dwarf:] “Faster!”

[Dwalin sees several goblins running at them from in front]

[Dwalin:] “Post!”

[He and some of the dwarves cut a guardrail post from the side of the path and they hold it out in front of them like a massive spear.]

[Dwalin:] “Charge!”

[He and the other dwarves charge at the oncoming goblins and sweep them away with the long rail. Dropping the rail, Dwalin pulls out his axes and begins knocking aside goblins. The rest of the company do the same. Gloin hits one goblin who falls and lands on another suspended path, breaking the path and dropping all the goblins on it into the darkness below. The rest of the Company also fight the goblins around them with their various weapons and fighting styles. Several goblins snarl as they swing on ropes toward the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Cut the ropes!”

[Thorin and some of the dwarves cut the ropes holding a raised platform in place; the platform falls outward, entangling the goblins swinging on the ropes. As Kili fights, several goblins start shooting arrows at him. He deflects some arrows with his sword; he then grabs a nearby ladder and drops it on the oncoming goblins. Kili and some of the other dwarves run forward, pushing the ladder and the goblins it has trapped in front of them. As they approach a missing area of the path, the goblins fall down into the darkness; the ladder, however, acts as a bridge for the dwarves to cross to the rest of the path. As soon as they cross it, Dwalin breaks the ladder, preventing the goblins chasing them from crossing it.]

[Gandalf:] “Quickly!”

[The dwarves and Gandalf continue running through the maze-like paths; they get on a section of the path suspended by ropes from above. They slice some ropes, and the pathway swings away from the rest of the path, approaching a different path.]

[Thorin:] “Jump!”

[Several of the dwarves manage to jump to the other path; however, before the rest can, the suspended path swings back like a pendulum to where it started, and several goblins leap on. As the path swings back again, the rest of the dwarves and Gandalf manage to jump to the new path as well; they cut the ropes, causing the swinging path and the goblins on it to fall. The dwarves and Gandalf continue running through the tunnels, killing all the goblins in their way. Gandalf strikes a rock above them with his staff, causing the rock to fall down and begin rolling in front of the Company, squashing all the goblins in their way. Soon, they approach a bridge between two walls of the cavern. As they try to cross it, the Great Goblin suddenly breaks through from underneath the bridge and pulls himself up onto the bridge, in front of the Company. As the Company pauses, hundreds of goblins approach them from all sides.]

[Great Goblin:] “You thought you could escape me?”

[The Great Goblin swings his mace twice and Gandalf, causing Gandalf to stumble back and almost fall.]

[Great Goblin:] “What are you going to do now, wizard?”

[Gandalf leaps forward and strikes the Great Goblin in the eye with his staff. The Great Goblin drops his mace and clutches his face in pain.]

[Great Goblin:] “Ow, ow, ow!”

[Gandalf steps forward and slices the Great Goblin in the belly; the Great Goblin falls to his knees, clutching his belly.]

[Great Goblin:] “That’ll do it.”

[Gandalf again swings his sword and slices the Great Goblin’s neck, causing him to fall down dead.]



[His weight causes the bridge to start shaking; suddenly, the section of the bridge on which the company is standing breaks away from the rest of the bridge and starts sliding down the side of the cavern. The bridge slides at a terrific speed down the cavern’s wall, demolishing everything in its way; the dwarves cling on, screaming in terror. The bridge slows down and lands at the base of the cavern, breaking apart and burying the dwarves in the timber and wood. Gandalf gets up from the pile of wreckage and inspects the rest of the dwarves, who are still stuck in the wreckage.]

[Bofur:] “Well, that could have been worse.”

[Suddenly, the heavy corpse of the Great Goblin lands on the wreckage, squishing the dwarves further. They cry out in pain.]

[Dwalin:] “You’ve got to be joking!”

[As the  dwarves extricate themselves from the rubble, Kili looks up and sees thousands of goblins running at them.]

[Kili:] “Gandalf!”

[Dwalin:] “There’s too many! We can’t fight them.”

[Gandalf:] “Only one thing will save us: daylight! Come on! Here, on your feet!”

[The dwarves get up quickly, helping each other out of the rubble, and they run away, following Gandalf.]



[Gollum jumps into a tunnel, a tunnel with an exit to the side of the mountain. Daylight is visible through the exit.]

[Gollum:] “Wait, my Precious! Wait! Gollum, Gollum.”

[Bilbo slowly approaches, invisible with the Ring on. He has his sword drawn. Hearing a noise, Gollum quickly hides behind a rock. As Bilbo watches, Gandalf and the dwarves run by, escaping through the exit. Bilbo, seeing his companions, is frantic. The dwarves and Gandalf run down the side of the steep, tree-covered mountain. Gollum again enters the tunnel, looking for Bilbo and the Ring. Bilbo, still invisible, put his sword to Gollum’s neck, then pulls back to swing the sword and cut off Gollum’s head. Before he can swing, however, Gollum turns around, looking down the passageway behind him. He cannot see Bilbo, but Bilbo can see him. Again, Bilbo places the tip of his sword at Gollum’s throat, but he hesitates upon seeing Gollum’s extreme sadness. For a second, Gollum looks almost human. Bilbo lowers his sword, pitying Gollum and remembering what Gandalf told him about swords and courage. Bilbo then looks determined and takes a deep breath, stepping back a few feet. Hearing Bilbo’s feet, Gollum frowns and begins to growl. Bilbo runs forward and leaps over Gollum, stepping on Gollum’s head and knocking him over in the process. Still invisible, Bilbo runs out the exit. Gollum jumps up and scrabbles around him, trying to grab the invisible Bilbo, roaring all the while.]

[Gollum:] “Baggins! Thief! Curse it and crush it, we hates it forever!”



[Still invisible, Bilbo runs down the mountain after the rest of the Company. Far in front of him, Gandalf pauses to count how many dwarves are with him. The dwarves pause to collect their breath.]


[Gandalf:] “Five, six, seven, eight...Bifur, Bofur...that’s ten...Fili, Kili...that’s twelve...and Bombur - that makes thirteen. Where’s Bilbo? Where is our Hobbit? Where is our hobbit?!”

[Dwalin:] “Curse the halfling! Now he’s lost?!”

[Gloin:] “I thought he was with Dori!”

[Dori:] “Don’t blame me!”

[Gandalf:] “Well, where did you last see him?”

[Nori:] “I think I saw him slip away, when they first collared us.”

[Gandalf:] “What happened exactly? Tell me!”

[Bilbo, still invisible, has caught up to the rest of the group. He hides behind a tree as Thorin speaks.]

[Thorin:] “I’ll tell you what happened. Master Baggins saw his chance and he took it! He’s thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth since first he stepped out of his door! We will not be seeing our Hobbit again. He is long gone.”

[Bilbo, who is still invisible, hears everything Thorin said. He leans on the tree as he ponders what he has just heard. The dwarves look at each other.]

[Bilbo:] “No, he isn’t.”   

[Bilbo steps out from behind the tree, no longer invisible. The dwarves look up in shock and relief. Gandalf laughs as he speaks.]

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins! I’ve never been so glad to see anyone in my life!” 

[Bilbo strides forward into the group; he pats Balin affectionately on the shoulder.]

[Kili:] “Bilbo, we’d given you up!”

[Fili:] “How on earth did you get past the Goblins?!”

[Dwalin:] “How, indeed.”

[There is an awkward silence as Bilbo tries to think what to say. In the end, he gives a nervous laugh and puts his hands on his hips. Gandalf is the only one to notice Bilbo sliding the Ring into his waistcoat pocket. Gandalf looks a bit perturbed.]

[Gandalf:] “Well, what does it matter? He’s back!”

[Thorin:] “It matters!  I want to know: why did you come back?”

[Bilbo:] “Look, I know you doubt me, I know you always have. And you’re right, I often think of Bag End. I miss my books. And my armchair. And my garden. See, that’s where I belong. That’s home. And that’s why I came back, cause you don’t have one. A home. It was taken from you. But I will help you take it back if I can.”

[After Bilbo speaks, there is silence as the dwarves think about what Bilbo said. Gandalf smiles slightly, happy that Bilbo has changed so much - for the better.]



[Azog and his Warg Riders get to the top of the mountain.]

[Azog:] [subtitle: Run them down! Tear them to pieces!]

[He swings his mace forward, and several of his Wargs (without riders) leap forward and race down the mountain after the Company, howling. Hearing the howling, the Company members realize they are in danger.]

[Thorin:] “Out of the frying pan...”

[Gandalf:] “...and into the fire! Run! RUN!”

[They all start running down the mountain as fast as they can. The Wargs follow them rapidly; it becomes nighttime. Soon the foremost Warg catches up to the group and leaps at Bilbo; Bilbo ducks behind a rock and the Warg’s jaws snap in the air over his head. The Warg lands in front of him. Growling, it charges at him.]



[Bilbo pulls out his sword and holds it in front of him; the charging Warg impales itself in the head on the sword and falls down dead. Bilbo looks on in surprise. A few more Wargs catch up to the fleeing dwarves, but they are quickly dispatched. The Company reaches a large outcropping of land with a few trees growing on it; they are trapped there, as there is no way off the outcropping besides a great fall down the mountain.]

[Gandalf:] “Up into the trees, all of you! Come on, climb! Bilbo, climb!”

[Bifur throws an axe, killing a Warg which was approaching him. Bofur jumps off a rock and grabs a tree branch, using Dwalin’s head as a stepping stone to the tree. Other dwarves begin climbing into the trees as well. Bilbo tries to pull his sword out of the dead Warg’s head, but it is stuck firmly. He continues to pull.]

[Thorin:] “They’re coming!”

[Gandalf climbs to the top of the furthest tree; Dwalin boosts Balin up. Thorin, Bombur, and the rest climb up trees too. The main body of Wargs and Warg Riders approach. Bilbo finally manages to pull his sword out of the Warg; he looks up to see several more Wargs running at him. He quickly clambers up a tree as the Wargs rush below him. Dozens of Wargs circle the trees in which the Company members are perched. Gandalf reaches out with his staff and picks up a moth sitting in the same tree as him. Bringing the moth close to his face, he whispers to it; he then blows it gently, causing it to flutter away. The Wargs cease their growling and turn as the White Warg, with Azog on its back, approaches slowly. Thorin looks at Azog in shock.]

[Thorin:] “Azog?!”

[As his White Warg growls, Azog strokes it and talks ominously.]

[Azog:] “Nuzdigid? Nuzdi gast?” [subtitle: Do you smell it? The scent of fear?] “Ganzilig-i unarug obod nauzdanish, Torin undag Train-ob.” [subtitle: I remember your father reeked of it, Thorin son of Thrain.]

[Thorin looks stricken with pain and grief, realizing that Azog had captured his father.]

[Thorin:] “It cannot be.”

[Azog speaks to his Wargs and Riders.]

[Azog:] “Kod, Toragid biriz.” [subtitle: That one is mine.] “Worori-da!” [subtitle: Kill the others!]

[At his command, the Wargs leap forward and try to climb the trees. They jump as high as they can, scrabbling at the tree trunks and breaking apart branches in their jaws in their efforts. The trees shake violently at the assault, and the dwarves struggle to hold on.]

[Azog:] “Sho gad adol!” [subtitle: Drink their blood!]

[With the weight of the Wargs climbing it, the furthest tree from the edge of the cliff, which Bilbo and several other dwarves are in, gets uprooted from the ground and begins leaning wildly. As more Wargs grab onto it, the tree tips over and lands on the next tree; the dwarves and Bilbo jump from the falling tree to the next. However, this tree as well tips over; like dominoes, all the trees begin falling over. All the dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf manage to jump onto the last tree, on the very edge of the cliff. This tree doesn’t fall over. Azog laughs. Looking around in desperation, Gandalf spies a pinecone. He grabs it and uses his staff to set the pinecone on fire; he then throws it down amid the Wargs, who retreat in fear of the fire. Azog is startled and angry at the unexpected resistance. Gandalf lights two more pinecones and throws one down to Fili.]

[Gandalf:] “Fili!”

[Fili catches the pinecone. Bilbo and the dwarves gather pinecones and Gandalf sets them on fire; they then throw the flaming pinecones like missiles at the Wargs. All the area around the tree gets set on fire, forcing the Wargs to retreat a distance. At least one Warg gallops away with its fur alight. Azog roars in anger and frustration as the dwarves cheer. Suddenly, their cheers turn into cries of fear as the roots of the tree they are in start to give way; the tree tips precariously over the edge of the cliff, but comes to a rest sticking straight out away from the edge of the cliff. Gandalf looks down and sees the ground far, far, below. The dwarves try to hold on as they get flung around. Ori loses his grip on the tree and falls, but manages to grab on to Dori’s leg.]

[Ori:] “Aahhh! Oh! Oh no!”

[Dori:] “Mister Gandalf!”

[Because of the extra weight, Dori loses his grip on the tree as well and falls, but Gandalf quickly swings his staff down and Dori grabs on to the end of it.]

[Dori:] “Hold on, Ori!”

[Azog growls; Thorin, clinging to the tree, looks at him in hate and anger. Thorin pulls himself up, his sword drawn, and walks down the leaning trunk as Bilbo and the others, hanging from the tree, look on. Thorin runs through the burning ground at Azog and his White Warg. Azog spreads his arms wide with a smug grin on his face. Thorin growls as he runs with his sword up and his oaken branch shield held in front of him. Azog crouches, then roars as his Warg leaps at Thorin. Thorin tries to swing his sword, but the Warg hits him in the chest with its forepaw, smashing Thorin to the ground. The other dwarves in the tree look on in shock. Dori struggles to hold on to Gandalf’s staff.]

[Ori:] “Help!”

[As Thorin gets back on his feet, panting, Azog and his White Warg wheel around; they charge at Thorin again. Azog swings his mace and smashes Thorin in the face before Thorin can react. Thorin is brutally flung to the ground by the impact.]

[Balin:] “Nooo!”

[Azog roars in excitement. Bilbo manages to stand up on the tree. The White Warg clamps its jaws around Thorin and Thorin yells in pain. Dwalin tries to get off and tree to assist Thorin, but the tree branches he is holding on to break, swinging him precariously over the edge and preventing him from reaching Thorin.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin! Nooo!”

[As the White Warg holds Thorin in its mouth, Thorin manages to hit its head with the pommel of his sword. Roaring, the White Warg throws Thorin several feet away onto a flat rock nearby. Thorin lands heavily, his sword falling out of his hand. He is almost unconscious.]

[Azog:] “Biriz torag khobdudol.” [subtitle: Bring me the Dwarf’s head.]

[One of  Azog’s Warg Riders jumps off his Warg and approaches Thorin. Bilbo, seeing this, pull out his own sword, which glows blue. The orc approaches Thorin and places its sword against his neck; raising the sword, the rider prepares to decapitate Thorin. As he swings his sword down, Bilbo throws himself at the orc and knocks him over. As they fight, Bilbo manages to stab and kill the orc. As Azog growls in anger, Thorin goes unconscious. Pulling his sword out of the dead orc’s body, Bilbo stands in front of the unconscious Thorin and protects his body. He waves his sword wildly at Azog and the other Wargs. Azog smiles in hatred and speaks in the Black Speech to his Orcs; the translated meaning is:]

[Azog:] [subtitle: Kill him.]

[A couple of Wargs and Riders approach Bilbo, snarling. Suddenly, Fili, Kili, and Dwalin, who have managed to get off the tree, plow into the Wargs from the side and start fighting them. In the confusion, Bilbo yells and leaps forward, wounding a Warg. The White Warg hits Bilbo with his head and sends him flying, however. As the fighting around them continues, Azog and his White Warg approach Bibo to kill him. Fili, Kili, and Dwalin have been surrounded by Wargs, and Bilbo is at Azog’s mercy. Suddenly, the moth returns to Gandalf. Dori slips from the end of Gandalf’s staff, and Dori and Ori fall toward the ground far below. An eagle swoops out of nowhere and catches them on its back; they yell in fear as they are carried swiftly away. Several more Eagles appear and join the fray. Some grab Wargs and Orcs and toss them over the cliff. Others knock down trees, which crush the Wargs below them. Another Eagle fans the flames with its wings, causing an inferno which burns the Wargs. Azog snarls in frustration. One Eagle gently grabs Thorin and his sword in its talons and flies away. As Thorin is lifted off the ground, his oaken branch shield slips off his arm and lands on the ground. Azog roars and jumps back as an Eagle flies by him; the Eagle heads straight for an alarmed Bibo and snatches him off the ground. It then throws Bilbo, and he screams as he falls toward the ground, only to land  on the back of another Eagle. The rest of the Eagles proceed to snatch the dwarves out of the tree and fly away. When only Gandalf is left in the tree, the roots give way and the tree falls off the edge of the cliff. Gandalf leaps clear of it and is caught by an Eagle. As the Eagles fly away with all the Company, Azog and the few Warg Riders left growl in anger and frustration.]



[The Eagles soar through the sky over a great distance and over many landscapes. Thorin lies unconscious in one Eagle’s talons; the others worry about him.]

[Fili:] “Thorin!”

[The Eagles approach a massive rock structure shaped like a bear; it is the Carrock. The Eagle carrying Thorin gently deposits him and his sword on a flat area on top of the Carrock. Another Eagle lands on the Carrock and Gandalf slides off its neck, running toward the unconscious Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “Thorin! Thorin.”

[Thorin is not responding. Bilbo runs up. Gandalf places his hand on Thorin’s face and whispers a spell. Thorin’s eyes flutter open and he gasps for air. He speaks weakly.]

[Thorin:] “The halfling?”

[Gandalf:] “It’s all right. Bilbo is here. He’s quiet safe.”

[By now, the other dwarves have all been landed on the Carrock, and they surround the wounded Thorin. Dwalin and Kili help Thorin up. However, once he’s up, he shrugs them off and approaches Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “You! What were you doing? You nearly got yourself killed! Did I not say that you would be a burden? That you would not survive in the wild and that you had no place amongst us?”

[Thorin advances until he is face to face with Bilbo, who looks worried and frightened.]

[Thorin:] “I’ve never been so wrong in all my life!”

[Thorin grabs Bilbo and embraces him deeply. The other dwarves cheer loudly and slap each other on the back. Gandalf smiles. Bilbo, looking quite surprised, hugs Thorin back. ]

[Thorin:] “I am sorry I doubted you.”

[Bilbo:] “No, I would have doubted me too. I’m not a hero or a warrior...not even a burglar.”

[As everyone chuckles, the Eagles fly away, screeching. Thorin looks beyond Bilbo and sees something; he strides forward, and the others follow his gaze.]

[Bilbo:] “Is that what I think it is?

[In the distance, on the horizon, they see the outline of a single, solitary mountain.]

[Gandalf:] “Erebor—The Lonely Mountain. The last of the great dwarf kingdoms of Middle-earth.”

[Thorin:] “Our home.”

[A bird cheeps and flies by.]

[Oin:] “A raven! The birds are returning to the mountain.”

[More birdsong is heard.]

[Gandalf:] “That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.”

[Thorin:] “But we’ll take it as a sign - a good omen.”

[Bilbo:] “You’re right. I do believe the worst is behind us.”

[The Company looks on at the Lonely Mountain as the sun comes up behind them.]



[The thrush flies across the Desolation of Smaug, flying in front of the ruined gates of Erebor, and then finally lands on a rock on the side of the mountain. It picks up a snail and bangs the snail shell against the side of the mountain. Inside the mountain, a massive pile of gold, coins, jewels, and treasures is piled up in the throne room, and the sounds of the thrush echo through the massive chambers. Some of the gold is blown away, revealing Smaug’s snout beneath the pile. As Smaug slowly raises his head from beneath the pile, more treasure falls away from his face. The camera focuses on his closed eye. Suddenly, his eye opens, and Smaug growls.]

[The scene fades to black. As the credits roll, Neil Finn’s song “Song of the Lonely Mountain” plays.]


[It is nighttime; rain falls heavily upon a small, dirty-looking town.]

[On screen:] Bree - on the borders of the Shire

[A figure wearing a pack and a raincoat walks through the streets. A disheveled-looking man with his hood down walks across the street, eating a carrot {this is Peter Jackson}. The figure with the pack is considerably shorter than the other people on the street. The figure walks up to a building and pauses, inspecting the sign hung above the door. It says, “The Prancing Pony.” The figure, which is Thorin, looks about, then enters the tavern. As he walks through, the bartender hands a drink to a man.]

[Bartender:] “There you are.”

[There is much raucous talk and laughter throughout the busy tavern. A black cat perches on a counter. A waitress {played by Katie, Peter Jackson’s daughter} threads through the crowd at the pub carrying a mug and a platter of cheese and bread. Drunk and unruly customers get in her way, and she moves around them.]

[Waitress]: “Watch it!”

[She makes her way to Thorin’s table and sets down the mug and platter.]

[Waitress:] “Here you are.”

[Thorin:] “Thank you.”

[Thorin puts down his pipe, which he had been smoking. He tears apart his bread and begins to eat it. As he eats, he looks around at all the activities going on in the pub. Sensing something, he looks to the right and sees a bald, suspicious-looking man watching him. He looks to his left and sees another shady character watching him. Thorin puts his bread back on his plate and, as the two men stand up and move toward him, slowly wraps his hand around the handle of his sword, which is strapped to his pack next to him.]

[Suddenly, a figure appears at the table in front of him. It is Gandalf, and he sits across from Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “Mind if I join you?”

[As the waitress passes by, Gandalf catches her sleeve.]

[Gandalf:] “I’ll have the same.”

[The suspicious men back away as Gandalf begins to speak to Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.”

[Thorin:] “I know who you are.”

[Gandalf:] “Well now! This is a fine chance. What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?”

[Thorin:] “I received word that my father had been seen wandering the Wilds near Dunland. I went looking, and found no sign of him.”

[Gandalf:] “Thorin, it’s been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.”

[Thorin:] "He still lives; I am sure of it.”

[Gandalf looks up as the waitress sets his platter of food in front of him.]

[Thorin:] “My father came to see you before he went missing. What did you say to him?”

[Gandalf:] “I urged him to march upon Erebor; to rally the seven armies of the dwarves, to destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain. And I would say the same to you. Take back your homeland.”

[Thorin picks up his mug and drinks contemplatively.]

[Thorin:] “This is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?”

[Gandalf:] “No, it is not. The Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin. That dragon has sat there long enough. Sooner or later, darker minds will turn toward Erebor. I ran into some unsavory characters whilst traveling along the Greenway. They mistook me for a vagabond.”

[Thorin:] “I imagine they regretted that.”

[Gandalf:] “One of them was carrying a message.”

[Gandalf lays a dirty piece of cloth with a message and a picture of the Lonely Mountain drawn on it on the table and pushes it toward Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “It is Black Speech.”

[Thorin, who had been reaching forward to take the message, warily pulls his hand away.]

[Gandalf:] “Promise of payment.”

[Thorin:] “For what?”

[Gandalf:] “Your head. Someone wants you dead. Thorin, you can wait no longer. You are the heir to the throne of Durin. Unite the armies of the dwarves. Together you have the might and power to retake Erebor. Summon a meeting of the seven dwarf families. Demand they stand by their oaths.”

[Thorin:] “The seven armies swore that oath to the one who wields the King's Jewel, the Arkenstone! It is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.”

[Thorin and Gandalf look up as the two shady men from before rise and leave together, looking back over their shoulders at Thorin and Gandalf.]

[Gandalf:] “What if I were to help you to reclaim it?”

[Thorin:] “How? The Arkenstone lies half a world away, buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.”

[Gandalf:] "Yes, it does, which is why we are going to need a burglar."



[On screen:] 12 months later

[It is night in the present time, shortly after the ending of the first movie. Bilbo peeks over some rocks on a high ledge and watches Azog and his Warg Scouts running along a ridgeline not far away, occasionally stopping to smell the air in their pursuit of the Company. Not finding anything, they continue on their way. Suddenly, Bilbo hears a snarl from the side, and ducks behind the rocks. He peeks out and sees a large bear watching Azog from another pile of rocks, snarling softly. Bilbo sneaks away. The camera zooms in toward the bear, and the bear roars.]


[On screen:] THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG


[Bilbo has made his way down the rocks to where the dwarves and Gandalf are waiting to hear Bilbo's spy report.]

[Dwalin:] “How close is the pack?”

[Bilbo:] “Too close. A couple of leagues, no more, but that is not the worst of it.”

[Dwalin:] “Have the Wargs picked up our scent?”

[Bilbo:] “Not yet, but they will; we have another problem.”

[Gandalf:] “Did they see you? They saw you!”

[Bilbo:] “No, that's not it.”

[Gandalf smiles and turns to the dwarves.]

[Gandalf:] “What did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse. Excellent burglar material.”

[The dwarves chuckle loudly in appreciation of Bilbo. Bilbo looks exasperated that no one is hearing him out.]

[Bilbo:] “Will you listen- Will you just listen? I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.”

[The dwarves look worried.]

[Gandalf:] “What form did it take? Like a bear?”

[Bilbo:] “Ye..."

[Bilbo pauses and looks curiously at Gandalf.]

[Bilbo] "Y- yes. But bigger, much bigger.”

[Bofur, to Gandalf:] “You knew about this beast?”

[Gandalf turns and walks a few steps away.]

[Bofur:] “I say we double back.”

[Thorin:] “And be run down by a pack of Orcs.”

[Gandalf:] “There is a house, it’s not far from here, where we might take refuge.”

[Thorin:] “Whose house? Are they friend or foe?”

[Gandalf:] “Neither. He will help us, or he will kill us.”

[The dwarves looks at each other in dismay.]

[Thorin:] “What choice do we have?”

[A roar splits the night behind them; it is the bear.]

[Gandalf:] “None.”



[The company is running through plains and across streams.]

[Gandalf:] “Come on!”

[As the Company runs through a forest, Azog and his Orcs are racing through the forest too. Azog urges his party on. Both groups stop suddenly when an ear-splitting roar sounds nearby.]

[Gandalf:] “This way, quickly!”

[As the dwarves panic and run, Bombur looks on in shock until he is pulled along.]

[Bofur:] “Bombur, come on!”

[As they exit the forest, they spy a house surrounded by a hedge in the middle of a plain.]

[Gandalf:] “To the house! Run!”

[The Company runs across the plain; Bombur, the fattest dwarf, outruns all the rest of them in his fear. They run through a gate in the hedge.]

[Gandalf:] “Come on, get inside!”

[They run to the front door of the house; it is closed. Bombur, who reaches the door first, throws himself against it but falls flat on his back when the door doesn’t budge. The rest of the dwarves catch up and begin throwing themselves against the door, trying to open it. Gandalf looks back as a massive bear breaks out from the edge of the forest and runs toward them.]

[Gandalf:] “Open the door!”

[Thorin:] “Quickly!” 

[Thorin, pushing through the dwarves pressed against the door, manages to raise the exterior bolt, opening the doors. The entire company bolts inside the house and they try to slam the door shut, but the bear has already gotten its head in the door. As the bear roars and tries to push the door open, the dwarves yell and strain to close it. Bilbo pulls out his sword and points it unsteadily at the bear.]



[Gandalf looks on in apparent amusement. The dwarves yell as they press against the door.]

[Dwalin:] “Come on, lads!”

[With a final heave, the dwarves manage to close the door and drop the bolt across it. They sigh in shock, fear, and tiredness.]

[Ori:] “What is that?”

[Gandalf:] “That...is our host.”

[The dwarves and Bilbo turn to Gandalf in bewilderment.]

[Gandalf:] “His name is Beorn, and he is a skin-changer.”

[Oin checks his hearing trumpet to make sure he has heard Gandalf correctly.]

[Gandalf:] “Sometimes he’s a huge black bear; sometimes he’s a great strong man. The bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with. However, he is not overfond of dwarves.”

[The dwarves look at each other in dismay. Ori peaks out a crack in the door.]

[Ori:] “He’s leaving!”

[Dori pulls him away from the door.]

[Dori:] “Come away from there! It’s not natural, none of it. It’s obvious: he’s under some dark spell.”

[Gandalf:] “Don’t be a fool; he’s under no enchantment but his own. Alright now, get some sleep, all of you. You’ll be safe here tonight.”

[The dwarves start spreading out through the house. Gandalf whispers quietly to himself.]

[Gandalf:] “I hope.”



[It is night; Beorn’s house is seen from a distance. A massive bear is growling and walking around; from the edge of the woods, Azog and his company watch the bear. One of his Orcs comes up to him.]

[Orc:] “Bu margi hum. Guri shugi khozdayil” [Subtitle: Attack them now. Kill the Dwarf filth while they sleep.]

[Azog:] “Shâ. Hulim nari arangish” [Subtitle: No. The Beast stands guard.]



[Azog angrily walks away from Beorn and the house, and his Orcs follow. They walk back to where the rest of their group is; several Wargs are seen fighting each other.]

[Azog:] “Zadgarimid ru mong” [Subtitle: We will kill them on the road.]

[Azog and his Orcs all snap to attention when they hear a sound, and they pull out their weapons. Another large, pale Orc astride a Warg runs up to them, and the Warg stops inches from Azog, growling at his face. Azog stands without flinching, although he snarls. The pale Orc, Bolg, is holding a weapon shaped like a sharp spinal column, and he has iron plates embedded in his skull and chest. ]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”  [Subtitle: They are gathering in Dol Guldur. The Master has summoned you!]

[Azog growls in anger.]



[It is night in Beorn’s house. A mouse scampers across Beorn’s chessboard, which has pieces shaped like bears. The dwarves are sleeping all throughout the house. Some goats chew on hay. Bilbo, who was sleeping, sits up and looks around. After making sure that no one is watching him, he pulls out the Ring. As he examines it, a dark voice is heard chanting softly.]

“Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul,
ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum ishi krimpatul.” 

[translation: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.]

 

[As the chanting grows louder, the scene changes to Dol Guldur. It is night, and several Orcs are heading into the fortress.]

[Azog walks out onto a raised walkway in Dol Guldur. A darkness {“The Necromancer”} flies through the air and speaks to Azog.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: We grow in number. We grow in strength. You will lead my armies.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: What of Oakenshield?]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: War is coming.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You promised me his head!]

[The darkness flies right through Azog, and he spins around to face it.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Death will come to all.]

[The Darkness disappears, leaving Azog snarling. An Orc comes to him

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Do we call off the hunt?]

[Azog contemplates for a few seconds, then makes up his mind. He yells out a name into the dark.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Bolg!!]

[The Orcs turn as Bolg, much taller than any of the other Orcs, strides up to Azog, pushing the other Orcs aside. Scoff and Bog stand toe to toe, and they are equally large and dangerous looking. They glare at each other.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: I have a task for you. Do you still thirst for Dwarf blood?]

[Bolg, whose left eye is cloudy and blind, growls in agreement.]



[In the forest outside Beorn’s house, the bear ambles toward the house. At the edge of the forest, the bear stands on its hind legs, and its form melts into that of a tall man. The man looks toward the house.]

[Bilbo is sleeping in the house; hearing a noise, he wakes up and quietly peeks out of his blankets. He sees Beorn, in human form, enter.]

[It is morning; Beorn’s ponies prance through the fields. A very large bumblebee lands on Bilbo’s nose, waking him with a start. Putting on his jacket, he walks toward the kitchen, where all the dwarves and Gandalf are already seated. Beorn pours milk from a pitcher into Fili’s cup. He is much taller than any human, even taller than Gandalf. Beorn addresses Thorin.]

[Beorn:] “So you are the one they call Oakenshield. Tell me, why is Azog the Defiler hunting you?”

[Thorin:] “You know of Azog? How?”

[Beorn:] “My people were the first to live in the mountains, before the Orcs came down from the north. The Defiler killed most of my family, but some he enslaved.”

[Bilbo sees the remnants of manacles on Beorn’s wrist.]

[Beorn:] “Not for work, you understand, but for sport. Caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.” 

[Bilbo:] “There are others like you?”

[Beorn:] “Once, there were many.”

[Bilbo:] “And now?”

[Beorn:] “Now, there is only one.”

[The dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf look on in silence.]

[Beorn:] “You need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn?"

[Gandalf:] “Before Durin’s Day falls, yes.”

[Beorn:] “You are running out of time.”

[Gandalf:] “Which is why we must go through Mirkwood.”

[Beorn:] “A darkness lies upon that forest. Fell things creep beneath those trees. There is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur. I would not venture there except in great need.”

[Gandalf:] “We will take the Elven Road. That path is still safe.”
[Beorn:] “Safe? The Wood-Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin. They’re less wise and more dangerous. But it matters not.”

[Thorin:] “What do you mean?”

[Beorn:] “These lands are crawling with Orcs. Their numbers are growing, and you are on foot. You will never reach the forest alive.”

[Thorin looks shocked. Beorn stands up from the table and faces Thorin.]

[Beorn:] “I don’t like dwarves. They’re greedy and blind, blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.”

[Beorn picks up a mouse that had been scampering on the table and holds it, all the while approaching Thorin. who is standing with his arms crossed.]

[Beorn:] “But Orcs I hate more. What do you need?”



[The Company saddles and rides Beorn’s ponies. As they ride away, Beorn, who is staying at his house, looks around for danger.]

[Beorn:] “Go now, while you have the light. The hunters are not far behind.”

[The company rides rapidly across the land, slowing to a stop as they approach a looming, gloomy-looking forest. Gandalf dismounts and walks into the edge of the forest through an ancient archway.]

[Gandalf:] “The Elven Gate.”

[Gandalf turns and calls to the others.]

[Gandalf:] “Here lies our path through Mirkwood.”

[Dwalin:] “No sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.”

[Dwalin dismounts. Gandalf squints as he sees something in the distance; it is Beorn, in his bear-form, watching them from a distant ridge.]

[Gandalf:] “Set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.”

[The dwarves and Bilbo dismount and begin taking their supplies off the ponies. Bilbo approaches the forest on foot.]

[Bilbo:] “This forest feels...sick, as if a disease lies upon it. Is there no way around?”

[Gandalf:] “Not unless we go two hundred miles north, or twice that distance south.”

[Gandalf follows a path a few feet further into the shadows and approaches a plant-covered statue. At the same time, Bilbo, who is standing by himself, reaches into his pocket and, after some internal conflict, slowly pulls out the Ring and fingers it. Just like when he examined it in Beorn’s house, we hear the voice whispering the “One Ring to rule them all” chant. As Gandalf approaches the statue, Galadriel suddenly appears; she is evidently thought-speaking to Gandalf from Rivendell.]

[Galadriel:] “Something moves in the shadows unseen, hidden from our sight. Every day it grows in strength. Beware the Necromancer. He is not what he seems.”

[Gandalf approaches the statue apprehensively, then quickly yanks off the vines, revealing a painted-on Eye of Sauron. We see the Flaming Eye of Sauron burst on the screen for a second, and Bilbo, holding the Ring, gasps slightly.]

[Galadriel:] “If our enemy has returned, we must know. Go to the tombs in the mountains.”

[Gandalf, hearing her words in his head, nods in agreement.]

[Gandalf:] “The High Fells. So be it.” 



[The unladen ponies trot away; Nori is just about to finish unsaddling Gandalf’s horse when Gandalf emerges from the forest.]

[Gandalf:] “Not my horse! I need it.”

[As Gandalf strides forward, the Company looks up and murmurs in surprise.]

[Bilbo:] “You’re not leaving us?”

[Gandalf:] “I would not do this unless I had to.”

[Gandalf looks at Thorin, then turns and looks at a dejected Bilbo.]

[Gandalf:] “You’ve changed, Bilbo Baggins. You’re not the same Hobbit as the one who left the Shire.”

[Bilbo:] “I was going to tell you; I...found something in the Goblin tunnels.”

[Gandalf:] “Found what?”

[Gandalf leans forward curiously and suspiciously; Bilbo doesn’t answer immediately, but fumbles with the ring in his pocket.]

[Gandalf:] “What did you find?”

[Bilbo stays silent for several more seconds, then finally responds.]

[Bilbo:] “My courage.”

[He removes his hand from his pocket.]

[Gandalf:] “Good. Well, that’s good. You’ll need it.”

[Gandalf turns and begins walking toward his horse; he speaks as he passes Thorin.]

[Gandalf:] “I’ll be waiting for you at the overlook, before the slopes of Erebor. Keep the map and key safe. Do not enter that mountain without me.”

[Gandalf stops and looks hard at Thorin as he says this, then continues toward his horse.]

[Gandalf:] “This is not the Greenwood of old. The very air of the forest is heavy with illusion. It will seek to enter your mind and lead you astray.”

[Bilbo, to Dwalin:] “Lead us astray? What does that mean?”

[Gandalf gets on his horse. It begins raining lightly, even though the sun is out.]

[Gandalf:] “You must stay on the path; do not leave it. If you do, you will never find it again.”

[Gandalf wheels his horse and rides away.]

[Gandalf:] “No matter what may come, stay on the path!”



[Thorin and Company turn toward the forest.]

[Thorin:] “Come on. We must reach the mountain before the sun sets on Durin’s Day.”

[Dwalin:] “Durin’s Day. Let’s go!”

 [Thorin:] “This is our one chance to find the hidden door.”

[The Company enters Mirkwood. They are following the paved path that started at the Elven Gate. Thorin leads. At one point, the path turns a corner.]

[Thorin:] “The path goes this way.”

[As the dwarves and Bilbo keep following the path through the forest, it twists and turns over all sorts of terrain such as bare ground, high ledges, fallen tree trunks, and more. The color palette used is very blue/gray, and gloomy. Dwalin thumps the handle of his hammer on the ground to find the paving stones of the trail.]

[Dwalin:] “This way.”

[They continue walking.]

[Bofur:] “Air. I need air.”

[Oin:] “My head, it’s spinning.”

[The dwarves suddenly run into each other as Nori, in front, stops abruptly.]

[Oin:] “What’s happening?”

[Thorin:] “Keep moving. Nori, why have we stopped?”

[Nori:] “The path...it’s disappeared!”

[Dwalin:] “What’s going on?”

[Oin:] “We’ve lost the path!”

[They are standing in front of a steep cliff, and there is no path ahead of them.]

[Thorin:] “Find it. All of you look. Look for the path!”

[Meanwhile, the path is not far away from them, but on the other side of the cliff. They had unknowingly left it some time ago.]

[The Company wanders through the forest. The forest is beginning to affect them mentally, and they stagger about.]

[Balin:] “I don’t remember this place before. None of it’s familiar.”

[Dori:] “It’s got to be here.”

[Thorin:] “What hour is it?”

[Dwalin:] “I do not know. I don’t even know what day it is.”

[Thorin:] “Is there no end to this accursed place?”

[The dwarves are all muttering and rambling as they wander about. Bilbo absentmindedly plucks a spiderweb; it vibrates, and the vibrations continue through the various linked spiderwebs and far off into the forest. Bilbo plucks the web again. He hears a strange whispering noise.]

[They continue walking; Bilbo looks down and sees himself walking backward, although it’s actually just an illusion. He looks back at Dori, behind him, and sees himself. His entire vision begins shifting and tilting. Ori leans down and picks up a tobacco pouch. Dori then takes it from him.]

[Ori:] “Look.”

[Dori:] “A tobacco pouch. There’s dwarves in these woods.”

[Bofur takes the pouch from Dori.]

[Bofur:] “Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, no less. This is exactly the same as mine.”

[Bilbo:] “Because it is yours. You understand? We’re going round in circles. We are lost.”

[Dwalin:] “We’re not lost. We keep heading east.”

[Oin:] “But which way is east? We’ve lost the sun.”

[As the dwarves begin bickering indistinctly, Bilbo looks up and sees a bit of sun through the tree canopy far above him. He speaks quietly, and no one else can hear him over the bickering.]

[Bilbo:] “The sun. We have to find the sun. Up there. We need to-”

[The dwarves have started fighting and pushing each other around. Thorin stands apart, listening. He hears the strange whispering sound that Bilbo heard earlier and mutters to himself.]

[Thorin:] “What? What’s that?”

[The whispering continues; Thorin turns and yells at the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Enough! Quiet! All of you! We’re being watched.”

[Bilbo climbs up one of the trees nearby; as he crawls, he doesn’t notice the masses of spiderwebs all around him. His head breaks through the trees and into the air; suddenly, it is as if a spell has been broken, and Bilbo’s head clears. As he breathes deeply, he sees blue butterflies flying all around him. The sun is setting, and everything looks beautiful. Bilbo smiles and laughs. He then looks off into the distance and sees several landmarks. He calls down loudly to the dwarves below.]



[Bilbo:] “I- I can see a lake! And a river. And the Lonely Mountain. We’re almost there!”

[He hears no reply from the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “Can you hear me? I know which way to go! Hello?”

[Bilbo looks down, trying to see the dwarves. He hears a thumping noise in the distance and looks up.]

[Bilbo:] “Hello?”

[In the distance, trees move haphazardly under the weight of something approaching. The movement is coming straight toward Bilbo and the dwarves. Worriedly, Bilbo climbs down a bit and peers around. He steps forward, only to trip over a spiderweb and fall several feet, bouncing painfully off branches, and yelling in pain and shock the entire time. He catches himself on a branch, then watches in horror as a web parts to reveal a massive spider. As the spider opens its fangs and hisses at him, Bilbo yells and falls again, landing on his back in an even bigger spiderweb. He is stuck to it and is thus unable to resist as the spider wraps him up tightly.]



[All of the dwarves have also been captured by giant spiders; the spiders have hung them upside down from tree branches. A spider tows a web-encased Bilbo toward the dwarves, then reaches for him with its jaws, presumably to administer its poison. Bilbo wakes up and realizes what is happening; just as the spider bends toward him, he manages to swing his sword, which he had been holding, straight up from his body, through the web, and into the spider. He guts it and flings it over the edge of the branch he had been lying on, sending it crashing to the forest floor. Bilbo quickly rips off the cocoon of web he has been wrapped in. Looking up, he sees the dwarves wrapped up and hanging from branches; he hides behind a tree trunk as a spider climbs up the other side of the trunk.]

[Bilbo pulls out his Ring from his pocket and slips it on his finger. In addition to becoming invisible, he enters the Ring’s “other dimension,” and he can suddenly understand what the spiders are saying.]

[Spider:] “Kiilll theemm. Kiill theemm.”

[Spider:] “Eat them now, _ _ _ and runny.”

[Spider:] “Their hide is tough. There is good juice inside.”

[Spider:] “Stick it again! Stick it again! Finish it off!” 

[The spiders surround one wrapped dwarf; the dwarf kicks, but can’t do much when wrapped up so tightly.]

[Spider:] “Ahh! The meat’s alive and kicking!”

[Spider:] “Kill them, kill them now. Let us feast.”

[The rest of the spiders take up the chant, “Feast! Feast!”]

[Bilbo, holding his sword in front of him, approaches the spiders. He ducks just in time as a spider crawls along a branch above him, going toward the dwarves. Bilbo throws a piece of wood away and to the side, causing all the spiders to rush after the source of noise.]

[Spiders:] “What is it? What is it? Kill it! Feast! Feast!”

[One spider stays behind and prepares to eat a wrapped and squirming Bombur.]

[Spider:] “Fat and juicy. Just a little taste.”

[The spider drops Bombur to the tree trunk and prepares to eat him. Bilbo sneaks up and strikes it on its rear with his sword. The spider spins around and hisses, but Bilbo is invisible to it. Bilbo keeps slicing at it, slicing away a leg and part of its head.]

[Spider:] “Curses! Where is it? Where is it?!”

[Bilbo pulls off his ring, revealing himself to the spider. He gives a little smile before he speaks.]

[Bilbo:] “Here!”

[Bilbo thrust his sword directly into the spider’s head.]

[Spider:] “It stings! Stings!”

[Bilbo pulls out his sword and the spider, dead, crashes to the ground. Bilbo looks at his sword.]

[Bilbo:] “Sting. That’s a good name.” 

[Bilbo looks toward where the dwarves are still wrapped and tied up.]

[Bilbo:] “Sting.” 



[Bilbo uses Sting to cut down all the dwarves. They land on the forest floor and proceed to rip off their wrappings, cursing and yelling the entire time.]

[Bofur:] “Where’s Bilbo?”

[Dwarves:] “Bilbo!”

[Bilbo:] “I’m up here!”

[Just then, a spider jumps at Bilbo from underneath the branch he was standing on, and it pins him underneath it. However, he manages to put his sword in front of him just in time, stabbing the spider through the belly. As the spider falls off the branch, Bilbo, entangled in its legs, falls with it. As the pair smashes against branches on their way down, Bilbo’s ring falls off his finger and lands some distance away from where Bilbo lands. Bilbo gets up and begins stumbling toward where the Ring fell.]

[Meanwhile, the dwarves have freed themselves and they try to escape, only to be surrounded by the returning spiders. They fight against the spiders with their various weapons. Bombur is knocked to the floor by a spider, and it stands over him to bite him.]

[Dwarf:] “Grab a leg!”

[The other dwarves grab each of the spider’s legs.]

[Dwarf:] “Pull!”

[The dwarves pull at the spider’s legs, and they manage to pull its legs right off its body. The dismembered body of the spider lands on Bombur.] 

[Bilbo is looking around for the Ring.]

[Bilbo:] “Where is it? Where is it? Come on. Where is it?”

[Bilbo slowly looks over his shoulder; he sees the Ring lying on the ground nearby. Relieved, he begins walking toward it.]



[Suddenly, a young, odd-looking spider emerges from the ground just behind the RIng. The spider’s legs push the Ring aside as the spider crawls toward Bilbo. Bilbo looks at it angrily, then rushes at it with his sword raised, yelling all the way. He begins to hack at the spider in a berserk manner, hacking and slicing all over the place.]

[The dwarves are still fighting the spiders. A spider manages to grab Kili.]

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[Bilbo continues hacking wildly at the spider, slicing off limbs, feelers, and more. He sticks his sword in its throat, ripping it out, then jumps and stabs the spider through the head and into the ground. As the spider falls, Bilbo pants heavily. He grabs the Ring off the ground, then holds it up and shows it to the dead spider.] 



[Bilbo:] “Mine!”

[Bilbo sits down and examines the Ring; as he gazes on it, the enormity of what he has just down dawns on him, and he looks shocked. He looks down and sees all the spiderwebs and gore on himself. He covers his mouth in shame and disgustedness. He is about to put the ring away when he hears a noise.]

[The dwarves have defeated their spiders, and are running through the forest. More spiders jump down on threads of silk in front of the dwarves and hiss at them. Thorin raises his sword in preparation to fight, but pauses and looks up. A blonde Elf, Legolas, runs through the treetops, then swings down a spider’s silk in order to land on it and kill it. He slides on the forest floor under the spider facing Thorin, slicing it in half, and comes up kneeling with an arrow nocked in his bow and pointed at Thorin. Several other Mirkwood elves appear, drawing arrows and pointing them at the dwarves.]

[Legolas:] “Do not think I won’t kill you, dwarf. It would be my pleasure.”



[The dwarves look around and see that they are completely surrounded and outnumbered by Mirkwood Elves, all with drawn bows aimed at the dwarves.]

[Kili:] “Help!”

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[The dwarves whirl around and see a spider pulling Kili away by the foot. A female Elf, Tauriel, runs through the forest. She kills three spiders with her bow and knife, then kills the spider pulling Kili with an arrow. She turns to attack another spider behind her, and yet another spider rushes toward Kili.]

[Kili:] “Throw me your dagger! Quick!”

[Tauriel:] “If you think I’m giving you a weapon, dwarf, you’re mistaken!”

[Tauriel kills her spider with her knife, then spins and throws the knife, killing the spider that was attacking Kili. Kili looks on in amazement.]



[Legolas:] “Search them.”

[The elves approach the dwarves and start searching them. An elf confiscates two of Fili’s knives. Legolas pulls a picture frame with two pictures out of Gloin’s pocket.]

[Gloin:] “Hey! Give it back! That’s private!”

[Legolas looks at a picture of a dwarf.]

[Legolas:] “Who is this? Your brother?”

[Gloin:] “That is my wife!”

[Legolas looks at the other picture, which is of a dwarf child.]

[Legolas:] “And what is this horrid creature? A goblin mutant?”

[Gloin:] “That’s my wee lad, Gimli.”

[Legolas raises his eyebrow at Gloin in contempt.]

[Meanwhile, the elf searching Fili finds even more knives all around his person. Fili sighs when the elf finds even some in a secret hidden pocket.]

[Legolas:] “Gyrth in yngyl bain?” [Subtitle: Are the spiders dead?]

[Tauriel:] “Ennorner gwanod in yngyl na nyryn. Engain nar.” [Subtitle: Yes, but more will come. They’re growing bolder.]

[Fili opens his jacket to show the elf searching him that he has no knives left; however, the elf finds another one hidden in Fili’s hood. An elf hands Legolas Thorin’s sword, Orcrist, and he inspects it.]

[Legolas:] “Echannen i vegil hen vin Gondolin. Magannen nan Gelydh.” [Subtitle: This is an ancient Elvish blade. Forged by my kin.] 

[Legolas:] “Where did you get this?”

[Thorin:] “It was given to me.”

[Legolas points the sword at Thorin.]

[Legolas:] “Not just a thief, but a liar as well.”

[Legolas:] “Enwenno hain!” [Rough translation: Take them!]

[The elves begin to lead the dwarves away. As they begin to walk, Bofur turns and whispers to Thorin]

[Bofur:] “Thorin, where’s Bilbo?”

[Thorin looks around, but sees no sign of Bilbo.]

[The dwarves are led over a bridge and into the Woodland Realm. After they pass through, Legolas addresses the guards of the gate.]




[Legolas:] “Holo in ennyn.” [Subtitle: Close the gate.]

[Bilbo, invisible, is running along the bridge and toward the gate. Legolas turns, sensing something, and looks down the bridge. Seeing nothing after a few seconds, he turns and walks through the gates as they closes. Bilbo, unseen, slips through the gates before they close.]

[The dwarves are led through the raised wooden walkways of the Woodland Realm. The entire place is built out of tree roots in a subterranean cavern. We see the King of Mirkwood, Thranduil, Legolas’s father, sitting on his throne.]



[The dwarves are pushed, protesting, into several cells.]

[Dwalin:] “This is not the end of it! You hear me?”

[Gloin:] “Let us out of here!”

[Dori:] “Get off me!

[The elf in charge of Fili finds another large dagger hidden in his coat, and Fili sighs in frustration. Kili addresses Tauriel as she locks him in his cell.]

[Kili:] “Aren’t you going to search me? I could have anything down my trousers.”

[Tauriel:] “Or nothing.”

[As Tauriel haughtily slams the cell door shut and walks away, Kili looks after her and smiles a little. Legolas stops Tauriel on her way out of the prison corridor.]

[Legolas:] “I Nogoth amman e tîr gin? Tauriel?” [Subtitle: Why does the Dwarf stare at you, Tauriel?]

[Tauriel:] “Ú-dangada?” [Subtitle: Who can say?]

[Tauriel looks away from Legolas as she says the next line, smiling a little and looking dreamy.]

[Tauriel:] “E orchal be Nogoth.” [Subtitle: He’s quite tall for a Dwarf.]

[She suddenly realizes what she’s doing and quickly looks at Legolas.]

[Tauriel:] “Pedithig?” [Subtitle: Do you not think?]

[As Tauriel walks away, Legolas addresses her.]

[Legolas:] “Orchal eb vui, mal uvanui en.” [Subtitle: Taller than some, but no less ugly.]

[Legolas and Kili glare at each other.]

[Dwalin and several other dwarves throw themselves against their cell doors, grunting in their effort. Balin finally yells at them.] 

[Balin:] “Leave it! There’s no way out. This is no Orc dungeon; these are the halls of the Woodland Realm. No one leaves here but by the king’s consent.”



[Meanwhile, Thorin has been brought before King Thranduil, and Thranduil addresses him.]



[Thranduil:] “Some may imagine that a noble quest is at hand. A quest to reclaim a homeland and slay a dragon. I myself suspect a more prosaic motive: attempted burglary, or something of that ilk.”

[Thranduil looks closely at Thorin.]

[Thranduil:] “You have found a way in. You seek that which would bestow upon you the right to rule: the King’s Jewel, the Arkenstone. It is precious to you beyond measure. I understand that. There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight. I offer you my help.” 



[Thorin:] “I am listening.”

[Thranduil:] “I will let you go, if you but return what is mine.”

[Thorin turns and slowly starts walking away.]

[Thorin:] “A favor for a favor.”

[Thranduil:] “You have my word. One king to another.”

[Thorin stops walking. Still facing away from Thranduil, he speaks. His voice gets louder and louder as he speaks.]

[Thorin:] “I would not trust Thranduil, the great king, to honor his word should the end of all days be upon us!”

[Thorin spins around and point at Thranduil. He is now shouting.]

[Thorin:]  “You lack all honor! I’ve seen how you treat your friends. We came to you once, starving, homeless, seeking your help, but you turned your back. You turned away from the suffering of my people and the inferno that destroyed us!” 

[Thorin:]  “Imrid amrad ursul!” [Rough translation: Die a death of flames!]

[Thranduil leaps down from his throne and puts his face right in front of Thorin’s.]

[Thranduil:] “Do not talk to me of dragon fire. I know its wrath and ruin. I have faced the great serpents of the north.” 

[As Thranduil speaks, his face contorts, and we see his face covered with what appears to be burns and scars from his past encounters with dragons. His left eye is milky and unseeing. He draws away, and his face returns to normal.]

[Thranduil:] “I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon, but he would not listen.”

[Thranduil turns and walks up the steps to his throne.]

[Thranduil:] “You are just like him.”

[Thranduil motions, and guards grab Thorin and haul him toward the dungeons.]

[Thranduil:] “Stay here if you will, and rot. A hundred years is a mere blink in the life of an elf. I am patient. I can wait.”



[Thorin is thrown into a cell beside the other dwarves, and his jailer walks away with a ring of jangling keys.]

[Balin:] “Did he offer you a deal?”

[Thorin:] “He did. I told him he could go ‘Ish kakhfê ai’d dur rugnu!’ [Rough translation: I spit upon your grave!] - him and all his kin!”

[Hearing this, Balin closes his eyes and sighs wearily in frustration.]

[Balin:] “Well...that’s it, then. A deal was our only hope.”

[Thorin:] “Not our only hope.” 



[We see Bilbo, invisible, sneaking through the Woodland Realm. Suddenly, Thranduil steps out from behind a corner and seemingly addresses him. Bilbo gives a little start, thinking that his invisibility doesn’t work.]

[Thranduil:] “I know you’re there. Why do you linger in the shadows?”

[Bilbo is petrified, thinking he has been found out, when suddenly Tauriel steps out of the shadows behind him. Realizing that the king was talking to her, Bilbo sighs in relief.]

[Tauriel:] “I was coming to report to you.”



[Thranduil:] “I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not two moons past.”

[Tauriel:] “We cleared the forest as ordered, my lord, but more spiders keep coming up from the south. They are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur; if we could kill them at their source-”

[Thranduil interrupts Tauriel.]

[Thranduil:] “That fortress lies beyond our borders. Keep our lands clear of those foul creatures, that is your task.”

[Tauriel:] “And when we drive them off, what then? Will they not spread to other lands?”



[Thranduil:] “Other lands are not my concern. The fortunes of the world will rise and fall, but here in this kingdom, we will endure.”

[Bilbo sneaks away; Thranduil, hearing a noise caused by Bilbo, looks his way. However, he looks back at Tauriel as she bows and walks away.]

[Thranduil:] “Legolas said you fought well today.”

[Tauriel smiles.]

[Thranduil:] “He has grown very fond of you.”

[Tauriel looks away, shocked and embarrassed.]

[Tauriel:] “I assure you, my lord, Legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.”

[Thranduil:] “Perhaps he did once. Now, I’m not so sure.”

 [Thranduil walks past Tauriel to pour himself a cup of drink. Tauriel stays rooted in her spot, looking worried.]

[Tauriel:] “I do not think you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan elf.” 

[Thranduil:] “No, you are right. I would not. Still, he cares about you. Do not give him hope where there is none.”

[Behind Thranduil’s back, Tauriel looks worried and anguished.]



[Bolg and his orcs spy on the gate to the Woodland Realm.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The gates are guarded.]

[Bolg:] “Shugi golgai. Tud-dad nu!” [Subtitle: Not all of them. Follow me!]

[Bolg and his orcs stride away down the river.]



[In his cell, Kili inspects a shiny black stone with an engraving in his hand. He flips it in the air and catches it on the back of his hand. Tauriel is checking on all the prisoners; she pauses at Kili’s cell.]

[Tauriel:] “The stone in your hand, what is it?”



[Kili:] “It is a talisman. A powerful spell lies upon it. If any but a dwarf reads the runes on this stone, they will be forever cursed.”

[Kili quickly holds up the stone toward Tauriel, and she steps back slightly. She begins to walk away, but stops when Kili speaks again, in a laughing manner.]

[Kili:] “Or not, depending on whether you believe that kind of thing. It’s just a token.”

[Kili smiles, and Tauriel smiles as well.]

[Kili:] “A runestone. My mother gave it to me so I’d remember my promise.”

[Tauriel:] “What promise?”

[Kili:] “That I will come back to her.”

[Tauriel looks down.]

[Kili:] “She worries. She thinks I’m reckless.”

[Tauriel:] “Are you?”

[Kili:] “Nah.”

[He smiles and tosses up his stone. He misses when he tries to catch it, and it rolls out of his cell, but Tauriel stops it with her foot before it can roll into the deep pit outside the cells. She picks it up and inspects it. Kili goes up to the bars of his cell, then hears elves laughing in the distance.]

[Kili:] “Sounds like quite a party you’re having up there.”

[Tauriel:] “It is Mereth-en-Gilith, the Feast of Starlight.”

[She steps slightly away.]

[Tauriel:] “All light is sacred to the Eldar, but Wood Elves love best the light of the stars.”

[Kili:] “I always thought it is a cold light, remote and far away.”

[Tauriel, who had walked a few steps away while speaking, approaches Kili again and speaks earnestly.]

[Tauriel:] “It is memory, precious and pure. Like your promise.”

[Tauriel smiles and hands Kili back his stone.]

[Tauriel:] “I have walked there sometimes, beyond the forest and up into the night. I have seen the world fall away and the white light forever fill the air.”

[Kili:] “I saw a fire moon once. It rose over the pass near Dunland, huge; red and gold it was, filled the sky. We were an escort for some merchants from Ered Luin, they were trading in Silverbuck for furs. We took the Greenway south, keeping the mountain to our left, and then, this huge fire moon, right in our path. I wish I could show you...”

[They continue talking; Tauriel sits down on the stairs by Kili’s cell to listen. Unseen by them, Legolas watches from the distance, his face a blank mask.]



[Bilbo invisibly walks through the wine cellar. He sees elves moving around wine barrels and speaking. Once drinks from a large flagon; Bilbo sees the ring of dungeon keys in his hand.]

[Elf:] “...we’re running out of drink.”

[Elf:] “These empty barrels should have been sent back to Esgarrouth hours ago. The bargeman will be waiting for them.”

[Elf:] “Say what you like about our ill-tempered king, but he has excellent taste in wine. Come, Elros, try it.”

[He is speaking to an elf with a bunch of keys.]

[Elros:] “I have the dwarves in my charge.”

[The other elf takes the keys and hangs them on a hook in the wall.]

[Elf:] “They’re locked up; where can they go?”

[The elves laugh; Bilbo takes note of the hanging keys.]



[Bofur:] “I’ll wager the sun’s on the rise. It must be nearly dawn.”

[Ori:] “We’re never going to reach the mountain, are we?”

[Bilbo suddenly appears, holding up the ring of keys.]

[Bilbo:] “Not stuck in here, you’re not!” 



[Thorin and the other dwarves jump up in surprise; Bilbo hastily tucks his Ring into his pocket.] 

[Balin:] “Bilbo!”

[As the dwarves exclaim in surprise, Bilbo shushes them.]

[Bilbo:] “Shhh! There are guards nearby!”

[Bilbo unlocks Thorin’s cell and lets him out. He then proceeds to let all the dwarves out of their various cells, and they chuckle gleefully at their good fortune. Some of the dwarves start walking in a certain direction.]

[Dwarf:] “The stairs. You first. Ori!”

[Bilbo:] “Not that way, down here. Follow me.” 

[Bilbo proceeds lead the dwarves through the Woodland Realm, and they whisper indistinctly. They sneak through the halls of the Woodland Realm, and eventually find themselves in the wine cellar from before. The elves there are sound asleep around a table, with several empty bottles of wine in front of them. Bilbo leads the dwarves further in.]

[Bilbo:] “This way.”

[Kili:] “I don’t believe it;  we’re in the cellars!”

[The dwarves are getting mad at Bilbo.]

[Bofur:] “You were supposed to be leading us out, not further in!”

[Bilbo:] “I know what I’m doing!”

[Bofur:] “Shhh!”

[Bilbo:] “This way.”

[They sneak into a large room in which several barrels are stacked sideways down the middle of the room. All the barrels have one end open.]


[Meanwhile, elven guards open the cells and find them empty.]

[Elf:] “_ _ _!” 



[Bilbo:] “Everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!”

[Dwalin:] “Are you mad?! They’ll find us!”

[Bilbo:] “No, no, they won’t, I promise you. Please, please, you MUST trust me!”

[The dwarves mill around, as they try to decide. They hear a commotion in the distance.] 

[Thorin:] “Do as he says!”

[Each of the dwarves climbs into a barrel. Bilbo walks along, counting to make sure all the dwarves have been accounted for.]

[Bofur:] “What do we do now?”



[All the dwarves stick their heads out of their barrels and watch Bilbo as he walks toward a lever in the ground.]

[Bilbo:] “Hold your breath.”
		


[Bofur:] “Hold my breath? What do you  mean?”

[Bilbo pulls the lever, and the part of the floor that the barrels were on tilts downward into an opening; the barrels roll out the opening and fall several feet into a river that runs beneath the Woodland Realm. The dwarves yell as they fall, and the barrels make loud thumping noises. The elves sleeping around the table stir and begin to wake up. Bilbo triumphantly looks around, then realizes that he forgot to get out himself, and that the trap door has closed.]




[Tauriel strides up to the empty cells and address the other elven guards.]

[Tauriel:] “Where is the keeper of the keys?” 

[In the cellar, Bilbo frantically runs back and forth and stomps on the ground, trying to make the floor tip again. Tauriel and her elves run toward the cellar.]

[Tauriel:] “Tolo hi!” [Rough translation: Come now!]

[Just as Tauriel and the guards get to the cellar, the floor tips and Bilbo falls into the river, yelling. He surfaces and grabs onto Nori’s barrel. Thorin and the company, still in their barrels, have been waiting for him.]



[Thorin:] “Well done, Master Baggins.” 

[Bilbo, half drowned, waves his hand in thanks and manages to splutter out a word.]

[Bilbo:] “Go.”

[Thorin:] “Come on, let’s go.”

[The dwarves paddle with their hands as the river pulls their barrels along; elves rush along passages in the Woodland Realm. The dwarves emerge into the sunlight, and Thorin sees a waterfall right in front of them.]

[Thorin:] “Hold on!”

[The dwarves, Bilbo, and the barrels plunge through the rapids, then float swiftly down the raging river. Legolas, followed by other elves, emerges from a gateway and sees them floating away.]

[Legolas:] “Holo in-annon!” [Subtitle: Shut the gate!]

[An elf with him blows on a horn; as the dwarves round a corner in the river, they see a guardpost built above the river. The heavily armored elves standing guard there hear the horn and come to attention; one of them pulls a lever, causing a heavy metal sluice gate to block the river. The dwarves in their barrels come to a stop at the gate, unable to float further.]



[Thorin:] “No!”

[The barrels pile into each other; the elven guards draw their swords, but one is suddenly shot in the back with a black arrow. Several growling orcs swarm over the guardpost, killing the elves. Multitudes of orcs run in from the bushes, with Bolg.]

[Bofur:] “Watch out! Those are orcs!”

[Bolg:] “Gorid! Zib! Goridug!” [Subtitle: Slay them all!]

[The orcs begin throwing themselves at the dwarves in their barrels; Bilbo manages to kill one with Sting, and Dwalin elbows another in the face. Kili looks up and sees the lever the elven guard had pulled earlier. He manages to get out of his barrel and runs up the stairs toward the lever. Unarmed, he ducks as an swings at him.]

[Dwalin:] “Kili!”

[Dwalin, who had managed to grab a sword from one of the elves or orcs, throws it to Kili, who then fights his way to the top of the stairs. As Kili fights an orc, another one leaps up from behind him, raising its spear to stab him. Fili throws a short sword or dagger and kills the orc, allowing Kili to fight his own opponent and kill it. Bolg, noticing Kili, pulls his bow and arrows from his back. As Kili reaches for the lever, Bolg fires an arrow, which hits Kili in the calf. Kili stops short, panting.]

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[Kili groans in pain and strains to pull the lever, but falls over onto his back. Bolg strings another arrow. Thorin looks shocked.]

[Thorin:] “Kili.”

[An orc leaps over to kill Kili, but an arrow suddenly flies into its head. Kili looks over and sees Tauriel running through the bushes. She shoots another orc, then kills others with her knife.]

[Bolg:] “Gor’-ash! Gor golginul! ” [Subtitle: Kill her! Kill the She-Elf!]

[Several orcs rush at Tauriel; Legolas and other elves appear from the bushes and shoot them down. As Tauriel, Legolas, and the other elves fight the orcs, Kili manages to grab the lever and pull it, opening the sluice get and letting the dwarves in their barrels through. He then falls on his back again in pain. The dwarves in barrels fall down another waterfall and float down the river. Bolg sees them.]

[Bolg:] “Khozdayin obguryash! Abgurid!” [Subtitle: After them!]

[Fili:] “Kili!”

[Kili manages to slide himself off the ledge and into his empty barrel below. As he lands in it, the shaft of the arrow in his leg breaks off on the edge of the barrel. Tauriel distractedly looks over at him and is attacked by an orc, but manages to kill the orc. The remaining dwarves and Bilbo plunge over the waterfall and continue floating down the rushing river, as Bolg and his orcs follow the river on land.]

[The dwarves try to paddle and steer with their hands, but to no avail; the river is running too wild. As they come to a narrow part of the river, orcs on either side begin shooting arrows at them. Meanwhile, back at the guardpost, Tauriel continues fighting orcs. Legolas leaps to the top of the guardpost as well.]

[In the river, an orc leaps at Thorin in his barrel, but he manages to kill it with a sword he grabbed earlier. Tauriel, Legolas, and the other elves run after the orcs chasing the dwarves, shooting them. An orc jumps from an overhanging tree branch toward Balin, but Thorin throws his sword and pins the orc to the tree; as the orc drops its weapon, Thorin catches it while floating beneath him, and he throws back to Bombur, who throws it to Nori, who throws it to Fili, who kills an orc with it. An orc leaps onto Dwalin barrel, only for Dwalin to headbutt it off and steal its axe. The dwarves see a low-hanging tree branch stretched across the river in front of them, with several orcs on it.]

[Thorin:] “Cut the log!”

[As he floats under it, Thorin hits it with his sword, then Bofur hits it with his weapon, and Dwalin, right behind him, hits the branch with his axe, breaking it and causing the orcs on it to fall into the river. Bilbo manages to climb atop a floating barrel.]

[Dwalin:] “Bombur!”

[Dwalin throws his axe to Bombur, who kills an orc that had just jumped onto his barrel. The Orc’s spear ends up pinning it to an overhanging tree branch; the other end of the spear catches onto Bombur’s barrel and catapults it through the air and onto the riverbank, where the barrel rolls and tramples multitudes of orcs. The barrel flips through the air to the other side of the river, where it tramples more orcs. Eventually, the barrel comes to a stop, and orcs surround it; however, Bombur kicks out the bottom, then sticks his arms holding axes through the sides. He then starts spinning rapidly with the axes extended, mowing down all the orcs around him. He then runs toward the river, tosses his axe to one of the floating dwarves, then gracefully jumps into an empty barrel.]

[Meanwhile, Legolas, Tauriel, and the other elves have caught up to the dwarves and orcs, and they fight the orcs. At one point, Legolas leaps over the river and lands with a foot on the heads of two dwarves, from this vantage point, he shoots orcs on either riverbank. He aims carefully, and manages to skewer two orcs through the head with one arrow. Legolas continues fighting orcs, using the heads of floating dwarves as stepping stones to get across the river. While he is preoccupied fighting an orc, another orc runs up behind him and raises its sword to kill him; Thorin, from his barrel in the river, throws his sword and manages to kill the orc behind Legolas. Legolas and Thorin look at each other with some sort of understanding; Legolas stops pursuing them as the dwarves continue floating down the river. It seems like all the orcs are dead. However, as Legolas watches the dwarves float away, an orc draws its bow and aims at him; it shoots, but its arrow is suddenly deflected in the air by Tauriel’s own arrow. As Legolas spins around in surprise, Tauriel attacks the orc and forces it to its knees. Just before she can decapitate it with her knife, Legolas stops her.]

[Legolas:] “Tauriel! Dartho! Ú-no hono. Ho hebo cuin.” [Subtitle: Tauriel! Wait! This one we keep alive.]

[Bolg and his remaining orcs continue chasing the dwarves.]

[Bolg:] “Ban khozdai-go! Sha-mogi obguryash!” [Subtitle: After them! Cut them off!]

[Legolas stares after the dwarves for a second, then turns and heads back toward the Woodland Realm. Tauriel watches the dwarves floating away, being chased by orcs, and looks conflicted as to whether or not she should follow them or Legolas.]





 
[Meanwhile, Gandalf walks up a hill and finds some ruins; he is then seen carefully climbing a narrow stone ledge built into the side of a tall, bare, mountain. Just as he reaches a door in the side of the mountain, the stone ledge he is standing on crumbles away, and he begins to fall, but manages to catch himself and climbs onto the entrance of the doorway. A set of metal interlocking bars that had in the past covered the doorway now sit broken and bent away from the opening. Gandalf steps through the doorway and into a short tunnel going into the mountain; he is suddenly grabbed by some invisible force and he is pulled swiftly into the mountain. The tunnel end in a vast, cavernous hollow in the mountain, and the ground falls away into the distance at the end of the tunnel. Gandalf manages to stop himself from falling into the pit. He blows the end of his staff and makes it glow; with this light, he examines his surroundings. On the far wall of the cavern, he sees a door similar to the one he had just entered; he goes to it by carefully walking on narrow stones set in the sides of the cavern.]



[This door’s metal grate has also been broken and bent away. Gandalf enters the crypt and sees a tomb inside. However, the cover of the tomb has been broken. Suddenly, a bird flies out of the broken tomb at Gandalf. Gandalf starts, then turns around to find Radagast behind him.]

[Gandalf:] “Oh, it’s YOU!”

[Radagast:] “Why am I here, Gandalf?”

[Gandalf:] “Trust me, Radagast. I would not have called you here without good reason.”

[Radagast removes his hat, and three birds fly into the nest on his head. He then replaces his hat.]

[Radagast:] “This is not a nice place to meet.”



[Gandalf:] “No, it is not.”

[They exit the crypt and look around at the cavern.]

[Radagast:] “Theses are dark spells, Gandalf. Old, and full of hate. Who was buried here?”

[Gandalf:] “If he had a name, it’s long since been lost. He would have been known only as a servant of evil. One of a number. One of nine.”

[Gandalf illuminates the lower part of the cavern, and we see eight other crypts like the first, all with their metal bars bent and broken away from the insides of the crypts.]



[Gandalf and Radagast leave the mountain.]

[Radagast:] “Why now, Gandalf? I don’t understand.”

[Gandalf:] “The Ringwraiths have been summoned to Dol Guldur.”

[Radagast:] “But it cannot be the Necromancer. A human sorcerer could not summon such evil.”

[Gandalf:] “Who said it was human?”

[Radagast, who had been walking, stops abruptly.]

[Gandalf:] “The Nine only answer to one master. We’ve been blind, Radagast, and in our blindness, the Enemy has returned.”

[Radagast looks shocked.]

[Gandalf:] “He is summoning his servants. Azog the Defiler is no ordinary hunter. He is a commander, a commander of legions. The enemy is preparing for war. It will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.”

[Gandalf turns and begins to walk away.]

[Radagast:] “Where are you going?”

[Gandalf:] “To rejoin the others.”

[Radagast:] “Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “I started this; I cannot forsake them. They are all in grave danger.”

[Radagast:] “If what you say is true, the world is in grave danger. The power in that fortress will only grow stronger.”

[Gandalf looks away.]

[Gandalf:] “You want me to cast my friends aside?” 





[The river has calmed down, and the dwarves paddle along in their barrels with their hands.]

[Thorin:] “Anything behind us?”

[Balin:] “Not that I can see.”

[Bofur:] “I think we’ve outrun the orcs.”

[Thorin:] “Not for long; we’ve lost the current.”

[Dwalin:] “Bofur is half drown.”

[Thorin:] “Make for the shore! Come on, let’s go!”

[The dwarves and Bilbo paddle to the riverbank; they climb out onto a slab of rock jutting out a bit into the river.] 

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[When Kili is on the rocks, he falls to his knees in pain from the arrow wound in his thigh; it has been bound with cloth, but blood is seeping through. Bofur looks at him concernedly.]

[Kili:] “I’m fine, it’s nothing.”

[Thorin:] “On your feet.”

[Fili:] “Kili’s wounded. His leg needs binding.”

[Thorin:] “There’s an orc pack on our tail; we keep moving.”

[Balin:] “To where?”

[Bilbo:] “To the mountain; we’re so close.”

[Balin:] “A lake lies between us and that mountain. We have no way to cross it.”

[Bilbo:] “So then we go around.”

[Dwalin:] “The orcs will run us down, as sure as daylight. We have no weapons to defend ourselves.”

[Thorin:] “Bind his leg, quickly. You have two minutes.”

[While they bind Kili’s leg, some of the dwarves sit down and Ori kneels by the river to empty his boot of water. Unbeknownst to them, a man, Bard, sneaks up over the pile of rocks and aims an arrow at Ori. As the dwarves realize a man is there, they jump up, and Dwalin, holding a branch, leaps in front of Ori. He raises the branch and begins to charge the man, but the man shoots his arrow and it embeds itself right in the middle of the branch, between Dwalin’s hands. Kili raises a rock to throw, but the man shoots the rock out of his hand too.]



[Bard:] “Do it again, and you’re dead.”

[Balin, who is standing near the edge of the group, sees a barge floating in the river behind Bard. He talks to Bard, approaching him slowly with his hands held in the air.]

[Balin:] “Excuse me, but, uh, you’re from Laketown, if I’m not mistaken? That barge over there, it wouldn’t be available for hire, by any chance?”

[Bard lowers his bow.]

[Bard climbs aboard his barge as the dwarves approach.]

[Bard:] “What makes you think I will help you?”

[Balin:] “Those boots have seen better days.”  

[Bard begins loading the dwarves’ empty barrels into his barge.]

[Balin:] “As has that coat. No doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed. How many bairns?”

[Bard:] “A boy and two girls.”

[Balin:] “And your wife, I’d imagine she’s a beauty.”

[Bard:] “Aye. She was.”

[Balin’s smile fades.]

[Balin:] “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”

[He is interrupted by Dwalin whispering loudly to Thorin.]

[Dwalin:] “Oh, come on, come on, enough with the niceties.”

[Bard:] “What’s your hurry?”

[Dwalin:] “What’s it to you?”

[Bard:] “I would like to know who you are and what you are doing in these lands.”

[Balin:] “We are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.”

[Bard:] “Simple merchants, you say?”

[Thorin:] “We’ll need food, supplies, weapons. Can you help us?”

[Bard looks at the barrels and examines the various dents and nicks they received during the fight with the orcs.]

[Bard:] “I know where these barrels came from.”

[Thorin:] “What of it?”

[Bard:] “I don’t know what business you had with the elves, but I don’t think it ended well. No one enters Laketown but by leave of the Master. All his wealth comes from trade with the Woodland Realm. He will see you in irons before risking the wrath of King Thranduil.”

[Bard boards his barge and tosses a rope to Balin. Thorin mouths to Balin.]

[Thorin:] “Offer him more.”

[Balin:] “I’ll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.”

[Bard:] “Aye. But for that, you will need a smuggler.”

[Balin:] “For which we will pay double.”

[Bard looks at him suspiciously.]



[The orcs run beside the river in pursuit of the dwarves, who the current has carried far ahead of the orcs.]

[Bolg:] “Sha mogi obguryash!” [Rough translation: Don’t let them go away!]



[In the woodland realm, Legolas and Tauriel have brought their captured orc to Thranduil’s throneroom. As Legolas stands with his knife pressed to the orc’s neck, Thranduil paces around it.]

[Thranduil:] “Such is the nature of evil. Out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads, a shadow that grows in the dark. A sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night. So it ever was; so will it always be. In time, all foul things come forth.” 

[Legolas:] “You were tracking a company of thirteen dwarves. Why?”
 
[Orc:] “Not thirteen; not any more. The young one, the black-haired archer, we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.”

[The orc speaks this while facing Tauriel; she looks worried.]

[Orc:] “The poison’s is in his blood. He’ll be choking on it soon.”

[Tauriel:] “Answer the question, filth.”

[Orc:] “Sha hakhtiz khunai-go, Golgi!” [Subtitle: I do not answer to dogs, She-Elf!]

[Legolas pushes the orc a bit as Tauriel whips out her knife.]

[Legolas:] “I would not antagonize her.”

[Tauriel:] “You like killing things, orc? You like death? Then let me give it to you!”

[Tauriel rushes forward with her knife, but Thranduil speaks.]

[Thranduil:] “Farn! Tauriel, ego! Gwao hi.” [Subtitle: Enough! Tauriel, leave! Go now.]

[The orc snarls at her, but Tauriel manages to regain her composure and leaves.]

[Thranduil:] “I do not care about one dead dwarf. Answer the question. You have nothing to fear. Tell us what you know and I will set you free.”

[Legolas:] “You had orders to kill them - Why? What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?”

[Orc:] “The dwarf runt will never be king.”

[Legolas:] “King? There is no king under the mountain nor will there ever be. None would dare enter Erebor, whilst the dragon lives.”

[Orc:] “You know nothing! Your world will burn!”

[Legolas:] “What are you talking about? Speak!”

[Orc:] “Our time has come again. My master serves the One. Do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you. The flames of war are upon you-”



[Thranduil, whose eyes have widened upon hearing about “the One,” suddenly whips out his sword and beheads the orc, leaving the orc’s head in Legolas’s hand.]

[Legolas:] “Why did you do that? You promised to set him free.”

[Thranduil:] “And I did. I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.”

[The orc’s body, although separated from its head, shakes violently. Thranduil stomps on its leg to stop the shaking.] 

[Legolas:] “There was more the orc could tell us.”

[Thranduil:] “There was nothing more he could tell me.”

[Thranduil turns and walks away, sheathing his sword.]

[Legolas:] “What did he mean by the ‘flames of war’?”

[Thranduil:] “It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.”

[Thranduil addresses the elven guards.]

[Thranduil:] “I want the watch doubled at all our borders. All roads, all rivers. Nothing moves but I hear of it. No one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.”



[Legolas approaches the elves guarding the entrance to the Woodland Realm.]

[Legolas:] “Holo in ennyn! Tiro i defnin hain na ganed en-Aran.” [Subtitle: Close the gate! Keep it sealed by order of the King.]

[Legolas turns to walk away, but one of the guards calls out.]

[Elf Guard:] “Man os Tauriel?” [Subtitle: What about Tauriel?]

[Legolas stops short.]

[Legolas:] “Man os sen?” [Subtitle: What about her?]

[Elf Guard:] “Edevín eb enedhor na gû a megil. En ú-nandollen.” [Subtitle: She went into the forest armed with her bow and blade. She has not returned.]

[As Legolas walks toward the gate, the guard points out toward the forest in the direction Tauriel went. Legolas looks anxious.]



[Bolg and his orcs arrive at the rock where the dwarves met Bard. One of the orcs tastes a pool of liquid.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _ nash! Agra-yi.” [Subtitle: Dwarf blood! They were here.]

[Bolg:] “Nuzdi-arg nash…hum an bunish!” [Subtitle: There is another scent…man flesh!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _“ [Subtitle: They have found a way to cross the lake.]



[Bard paddles the dwarves and Bilbo across the lake in his barge. It is very foggy, and the barge pushes aside ice floes. Suddenly, large stone formations appear out of the fog.]

[Bofur:] “Watch out!”

[Bard expertly poles the barge between the rock formations, which turn out to be ancient ruins.]



[Thorin:] “What are you trying to do, drown us?”  

[Bard:] “I was born and bred on these waters, Master Dwarf. If I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.”

[Dwalin:] “Oh I have enough of this lippy lakeman. I say we throw him over the side and be done with him.”

[Bilbo answer him slightly angrily.]

[Bilbo:] “Ohh, Bard, his name’s Bard.”

[Bofur:] “How do you know?”

[Bilbo:] “Uh, I asked him.”

[Dwalin to Thorin:] “I don’t care what he calls himself, I don’t like him.” 

[Balin:] “We do not have to like him, we simply have to pay him. Come on now, lads, turn out your pockets.”

[The dwarves begin pulling out their money and valuables. Dwalin whispers to Thorin.]

[Dwalin:] “How do we know he won’t betray us?”

[Thorin:] “We don’t.”

[Balin counts the money.]

[Balin:] “There’s, um, just a problem: we’re ten coins short.”

[Thorin:] “Gloin. Come on. Give us what you have.”

[Gloin:] “Don’t look to me. I have been bled dry by this venture! And what have I seen for my investment? Naught but misery and grief and-”

[Gloin stops talking when he realizes that all the others have slowly stood up and are looking at something in the distance. As the fog thins, we see the Lonely Mountain.]

[Gloin:] “Bless my beard. Take it. Take all of it.”

[Gloin hands Balin a sack of coins he had secretly withheld before. Bilbo coughs and gestures his head toward Bard, who is approaching the dwarves on their end of the barge.]

[Bard:] “The money, quick, give it to me.”

[Thorin:] “We’ll pay you when we get our provisions, but not before.”

[Bard:] “If you value your freedom, you’ll do as I say. There are guards ahead.”

[The dwarves turn and see the rooftops of Laketown in the distance.]



[Bard’s barge is stopped at a dock just outside the city; Bard hops off and speaks to a man. Meanwhile, the dwarves and Bilbo are hidden in the barrels on the barge.]

[Dwalin:] “Shh, what’s he doing?”

[Bilbo peers through a hole in his barrel.]

[Bilbo:] “He’s talking to someone.”

[Bilbo sees Bard point back at his barrels while talking to the man.”

[Bilbo:] “And he’s...pointing right at us!”

[Thorin looks anxious. Bard shakes the man’s hands.]

[Bilbo:] “Now they’re shaking hands.”

[Thorin:] “What?”

[Dwalin:] “That villain! He’s selling us out.”

[All the dwarves in their individual barrels listen anxiously; suddenly, dead fish are poured into the barrels. The dwarves splutter in surprise.]

[Bard poles his barge toward the gate of the city; on deck are the 14 barrels all full of fish, with a dwarf or hobbit inside as well.]

 [Dwarf:] “Oh god.”

[Bard kicks the barrel closest to him.]

[Bard:] “Quiet! We’re approaching the toll gate.”

[Gatekeeper:] “Halt! Goods inspection. Papers, please. Oh, it’s you, Bard.”

[Bard brings him boat up to the gatekeeper’s office, and the gatekeeper steps out to see him.]

[Bard:] “Morning, Percy.”

[Percy:] “Anything to declare?” 

[Bard:] “Nothing, but that I am cold and tired, and ready for home.”

[Bard hands the gatekeeper some papers.]

[Percy:] “You and me both.”

[As the gatekeeper takes the papers and goes into his office to stamp them, Bard looks around warily.]

[Gatekeeper:] “Here we are. All in order.”

[He holds out Bard’s papers, but a man, Alfrid, suddenly steps out of the shadows and grabs the papers.]

[Alfrid:] “Not so fast.”

[Alfrid reads Bard’s papers, then looks at his load.]

[Alfrid:] “Consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm. Only, they’re not empty, are they, Bard?”

[Alfrid tosses Bard’s papers to the wind and approaches him, with some of Laketown’s soldiers behind him.]

[Alfrid:] “If I recall correctly, you’re licensed as a bargeman, not a fisherman.”

[As Alfrid says this, he picks up one of the fish from a barrel and holds it up to Bard. He doesn’t see Bombur’s eyes looking up from the gap where the fish had been.]

[Bard:] “That’s none of your business.”

[Alfrid:] “Wrong. It’s the Master’s business, which makes it my business.”

[Bard:] “Oh come on, Alfrid, have a heart. People need to eat!”

[Alfrid:] “These fish are illegal.”

[Alfrid throws the fish he was holding into the water, then commands the soldiers.]

[Alfrid:] “Empty the barrels over the side.”

[The soldiers, lead by their captain, Braga, move to comply.]

[Braga:] “You heard him. Into the canal. Come on, get a move on.”

[The soldiers begin tipping the barrels over and letting the fish fall into the canal.]

[Bard:] “Folk in this town are struggling. Times are hard. Food is scarce.”

[Alfrid:] “That’s not my problem.”

[Bard:] “And when the people hear the Master is dumping fish back in the lake, when the rioting starts, will it be your problem then?”

[Bard and Alfrid stare at each other intensely for a few seconds, then finally Alfrid raises his hand to the soldiers.]

[Alfrid:] “Stop.”

[The soldiers stop tipping the barrels over and return to the buildings.]

[Alfrid:] “Ever the people’s champion, eh, Bard? Protector of the common folk? You might have their favor now, bargeman, but it won’t last.]

[Alfrid walks away.]

[Percy:] “Raise the gate!”

[A large portcullis blocking the channel is raised, and Bard begins to pole his barge through. As he passes, Alfrid turns around and shouts to him.]

[Alfrid:] “The Master has his eye on you; you’d do well to remember. We know where you live.”

[Bard:] “It’s a small town, Alfrid; everyone knows where everyone lives.”

[We see a bird’s eye view of Laketown; it’s a town built in the middle of the lake, and it looks quite poor and ramshackle. There are many channels of water throughout the town, through which various boats float. Bard poles his barge down the main channel.]





[Alfrid:] “All this talk of civil unrest; someone’s been stirring the pot, sire.”

[Alfrid is in the Master’s bedchamber, and the Master has just woken up and is standing in his nightgown. Alfrid empty’s the Master’s chamberpot out a window. The Master groans and moans as he stumbles about, then sits down, rubbing his knees.]

[Master:] “Gah! Auh!”

[Alfrid:] “Gout playing up, sire?”

[Master:] “It’s the damp. It’s the only possible explanation. Now get me a brandy.”

[Alfrid moves to comply.]

[Alfrid:] “The mood of the people, sire, it’s turning ugly.”

[Master:] “They’re commoners, Alfrid. They’ve always been ugly. It’s not my fault that they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar. Jobs, shelter, food, that’s all they ever bleat about.”

[Alfrid hands the Master a glass of brandy, and he drinks it all in one shot.]

[Alfrid:] “It’s my belief, sire, they’re being lead on by troublemakers.”

[Master:] “Then we must find these troublemakers and arrest them!”

[Alfrid and the Master, who is now dressed, descend to the Master’s study. The Master is drinking another glass.]

[Alfrid:] “My thoughts exactly, sire.”

[Master:] “And all this talk of change must be suppressed. I can’t afford to let them rebel, band together and start making noises. The next thing you know, they’ll start asking questions, forming committees, launching inquiries.”

[At his desk, the Master pours yet another tall glass of brandy.]

[Alfrid:] “Out with the old, in with the new.”

[Master:] “What?”

[Alfrid:] “That’s what they’ve been saying, sire. There is even talk of an election.”

[Master:] “An election!? That’s absurd. I won’t stand for it.”

[As the Master walks away, Alfrid speaks softly such that only he can hear.]

[Alfrid:] “I don’t think they’d ask you to stand, sire.” 

[The Master opens glass doors and walks out onto his balcony, looking over Laketown. He mutters to himself.]

[Master:] “Shirkers. Ingrates. Rabble-rousers. Who would have the nerve to question my authority? Who would dare? Who….Bard. You mark my words, that trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.”



[Meanwhile, Bard docks his barge. After looking around, he knocks over one of the barrels, and a dwarf falls out along with a pile of fish. Bard continues knocking over barrels. He reaches for Dwalin’s barrel, but Dwalin pokes his head up through the fish.]

[Dwalin:] “Get your hands off me.”

[The remaining dwarves and Bilbo struggle out of their barrels, looking greasy and slimy from the fish. The dock keeper looks on in shock. Bard approaches him and slips him a coin.]

[Bard:] “You didn’t see them, they were never here. The fish you can have for nothing.”

[Bard leads the Company away.]

[Bard:] “Follow me.”

[A woman working on a boat happens to look up and she sees the dwarves running through Laketown in the distance. She looks shocked.]

[As they stride through Laketown, Bard’s son, Bain, runs up to Bard.]

[Bain:] “Da! Our house, it’s being watched.] 

[Bard looks at Thorin and hatches a plan.]

[Bard and his son walk along back to their house. As they walk, a fisherman in a boat sees them and drops his eyepatch over one eye, then knocks with his staff on a wall nearby {This is Stephen Colbert}. Upon this signal, two boys run from the wall, and one knocks over a contraption which causes a hammer to hit a bell. At this signal, another man lights a match to light his pipe. He turns and looks at two men in a fishing boat right next to Bard’s house, and they nod and switch their poles to the opposite sides of the boat than before. They do this just as Bard and Bain get to their house and enter through the door. Just before Bard enters, he tosses an apple to one of the fisherman.]

[Bard:] “You can tell the Master that I’m done for the day.”

[Inside the house, Bard’s daughters, Sigrid and Tilda, greet their father.]

[Tilda:] “Da! Where have you been?”

[Sigrid:] “Father! There you are. I was worried.”

[Both daughters run to their father, and they hug. Bard then hands his bag to Sigrid.]

[Bard:] “Here’s something to eat. Bain, get them in.”

[As Bard looks out a window, Bain goes down some steps to the lower floor of the house, which is open to the water. After looking around, he knocks on the wall near the toilet three times. Dwalin’s head appears through the toilet, which is open to the water below.]

[Dwalin:] “If you speak of this to anyone, I’ll rip your arms off.”

[Dwalin raises the seat and begins to pull himself out of the toilet. Bain reaches out to help him, but Dwalin slaps his hand away.]

[Dwalin:] “Get off.”

[Bain:] “Up there.”

[Bain points up the stairs, and Dwalin goes up. Bilbo pokes his head up through the toilet, looking flabbergasted, and Bain helps him out. The rest of the dwarves follow and head upstairs.]

[Sigrid:] “Da...why are there dwarves climbing out of our toilet?”

[Tilda:] “Will they bring us luck?”

[Nori emerges from the toilet with some leaves stuck to his hair.]



[The dwarves are wrapped in blankets, and their wet things have been laid in front of the fire to dry. Some of them shiver.]

[Bard:] “It may not be the best fit, but it’ll keep you warm.”

[Tilda passes out blankets, and Bilbo thanks her when he receives one.]



[Bilbo:] “Thank you very much.”

[Thorin looks out a window and sees a wooden tower not far away. Atop the tower is a windlass, a giant cross-bow type weapon with four arms. Thorin looks at it in shock.]

[Thorin:] “A Dwarvish Wind-Lance.”

[Bilbo, who is sipping a hot drink from a mug, looks at the wind-lance too.]

[Bilbo:] “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” 

[Balin:] “He has. The last time we saw such a weapon, a city was on fire. It was the day the dragon came.”

[Thorin looks sadly away, and the scene switches to a flashback, but with Balin still narrating in real time.]

[FLASHBACK: Smaug is attacking the city of Dale. He blows fire, destroying buildings.]

[Balin:] “The day that Smaug destroyed Dale. Girion, the Lord of the city, rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.”

[The city is in flames, but a man in armor, Girion, leads a group of archers in shooting at the flying dragon.]

[Balin:] “But a dragon’s hide is tough, tougher than the strongest armor. Only a black arrow, fired from a wind-lance, could have pierced the dragon’s hide, and few of those arrows were ever made.”

[Girion runs to a rack holding three long, heavy, black arrows, each made of metal and at least 4 feet long, and grabs one. He turns and loads it into a Dwarvish Wind-Lance, and draws the arrow. He turns the wind-lance, aiming for the dragon. It is difficult to see the dragon because it is flying swiftly and because the air is full of smoke. Girion fires, and the arrow hurtles through the air. It hits the dragon in the chest but bounces harmlessly off.] 

[Balin:] “His store was running low when Girion made his last stand.”

[Girion grabs another black arrow into the wind-lance and fires. This arrow too finds it mark, but bounces off the dragon’s chest.]
 
[END OF FLASHBACK.]

[Thorin:] “Had the aim of Men been true that day, much would have been different.”



[Bard approaches Thorin.]

[Bard:] “You speak as if you were there.”  

[Thorin:] “All dwarves know the tale.”

[Bain:] “Then you would know that Girion hit the dragon. He loosened a scale under the left wing. One more shot and he would have killed the beast.”

[Dwalin:] “Ha ha ha! That’s a fairy story, lad. Nothing more.”

[Thorin strides up to Bard.]

[Thorin:] “You took our money. Where are the weapons?”

[Bard:] “Wait here.”

[Bard goes down the stairs to the lower part of the house. After looking around to make sure no one is watching, he pulls on a rope hanging off a small boat and pulls up a wrapped package that had been hidden underwater.]



[While Bard is doing this, Thorin, Balin, Fili, and Kili talk quietly together.]

[Thorin:] “Tomorrow begins the last days of autumn.”

[Balin:] “Durin’s Day falls morn after next. We must reach the mountain before then.”

[Kili:] “And if we do not? If we fail to find the hidden door before that time?”

[Fili:] “Then this quest has been for nothing.”

[Bard returns and lays the package on the table as the dwarves stand around it. He loosens the wrappings and reveals a couple of hand-made weapons. The dwarves look at them in shock, then pick up the weapons and look at them in disgust.]



[Thorin:] “What is this?”

[Bard:] “Pike-hook. Made from an old harpoon.”

[Kili:] “And this?”

[Bard:] “A crowbill, we call it, fashioned from a smithy’s hammer. It’s heavy in hand, I grant, but in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.”

[Thorin and Dwalin look disgustedly at each other.]

[Gloin:] “We paid you for weapons. Iron-forged swords and axes!”

[Bofur:] “It’s a joke!”

[Bofur throws his weapon back on the table, and the other dwarves follow suit.]

[Bard:] “You won’t find better outside the city armory. All iron-forged weapons are held there under lock and key.”

[Thorin and Dwalin look at each other out of the corners of their eyes, hatching a plan.]

[Balin:] “Thorin.”

[Bard looks up at the mention of the name Thorin, as if the name sounds familiar to him.]

[Balin:] “Why not take what’s been offered and go? I’ve made do with less; so have you. I say we leave now.”

[Bard:] “You’re not going anywhere.”

[Dwalin:] “What did you say!?”

[Bard:] “There’s spies watching this house and probably every dock and wharf in the town. You must wait till nightfall.”

[Hearing this, the dwarfs begin to settle down. Kili, leaning on a pole, looks like he’s in pain and he slowly slides down the pole and sits on a couch. Wincing, he examines the bandage on his leg while making sure no one is looking.]

[Bard is standing on his porch; he talks to himself, trying to recall where he’d heard the name ‘Thorin’ before.]

[Bard:] “Thorin…”

[With a sudden shock of understanding, he whirls around and looks at the Lonely Mountain in the distance. The door opens, and Bain sticks his head out.]

[Bain:] “Da?”

[Bard:] “Don’t let them leave.”

[Bard hurries down his steps and into the town.]



[Tauriel, in pursuit of the orcs, comes to a rocky promontory at the end of the river and at at the banks of the lake. Far across the lake, Laketown is visible. On the rocks are pieces of a deer that the orcs had previously shot and ripped apart. Hearing something, Tauriel turns her head slightly and reaches for something at her side. She whips around and comes to a crouch with an arrow nocked to her bow. Several yards behind her is Legolas, also with his bow drawn.]



[Tauriel:] “Ingannen le Orch.” [Subtitle: I thought you were an Orc.]

[Legolas:] “Cí Orch im, dangen le.” [Subtitle: If I were an Orc, you would be dead.]

[They both lower their bows.]

[Legolas:] “Tauriel, you cannot hunt thirty orcs on your own.”

[Tauriel:] “But I’m not on my own.”

[Legolas smiles.]

[Legolas:] “You knew I would come.”

[Tauriel smiles.]

[Legolas:] “The king is angry, Tauriel. For 600 years, my father has protected you, favored you. You defied his orders; you betrayed his trust.”



[Legolas:] “Dandolo na nin...e gohenatha.” [Subtitle: Come back with me...he will forgive you.]

[Tauriel:] “Ú-’ohenathon. Cí dadwenithon, ú-’ohenathon im.” [Subtitle: But I will not. If I go back, I will not forgive myself.]

[Tauriel:] “The king has never let orc-filth from our lands, yet he would let this orc-pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.”

[Legolas:] “It is not our fight.”

[Tauriel:] “It is our fight. It will not end here. With every victory, this evil will grow. If your father has his way, we will do nothing. We will hide within our walls, live our lives away from the light, and let darkness descend. Are we not part of this world?”



[Tauriel:] “Tell me, mellon [Elvish for “friend”], when did we let evil become stronger than us?”

[Legolas looks conflicted.]



[Bard runs through Laketown. He runs into a shop, and the storekeeper greets him.]



[Storekeeper:] “Hello, Bard. What’re you after?”

[Bard begins looking through a pile of tapestries.]

[Bard:] “There was a tapestry, an old one; where’s it gone?”

[Storekeeper:] “What tapestry you talking about?”

[Bard:] “This one.”

[He picks up a tapestry and unrolls it on a table. It has the names of the members of the Line of Durin sewn into it. He overhears the woman who saw the dwarves earlier speaking to some other townpeople not far away.]

[Woman:] “There were dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere. Full beards, fierce eyes; I’ve never seen the like.”

[Fisherman:] “What are dwarves doing in these parts?”

[Old man:] “It’s the prophecy.”

[Fisherman:] “Prophecy?”

[Old man:] “The prophecy of Durin’s folk.”

[Bard traces through the lineage on the tapestry and finds the last entry, Thorin. He looks up, thinking deeply, and talks to himself.]

[Bard:] “The prophecy...prophecy.”

[The people of Laketown are beginning to talk about the dwarves now as the word spreads.]

[Man:] “The old tales will come true.”

[Woman:] “Vast halls of treasure!”

[Another woman:] “Can it really be true? Has the lord of silver fountains returned?”

[This phrase jolts Bard’s memory, and he begins to recite the prophecy to himself.]

[Bard:] “The lord of silver fountains,
The king of carven stone,
The king beneath the mountain shall come into his own,
And the bells shall ring in gladness at the mountain king’s return,
But all shall fail in sadness and the lake will shine and burn.”

[Bard runs quickly to his house; the setting sun causes the lake to glow orange as he recites the last line of the prophecy. Bard burst into his house and finds no dwarves remaining. His son comes up to him.]

[Bain:] “Da! I tried to stop them-”

[Bard:] “How long have they been gone!?”



[It is night at Laketown. The dwarves are sneaking through the town toward the armory, hiding from watchmen. They hide behind a boat as two watchmen walk by.]

[Dwalin:] “Shh! Keep it down.”

[Thorin:] “As soon as we have the weapons, we make straight for the mountain. Go, go, go!”

[With the watchmen gone, Thorin points to Nori, who gets a running start and runs up a pyramid of dwarves who have pressed themselves against the walls of the city armory. He is able to get high enough that he can reach a second floor window and dive through.]

[Thorin:] “Next.”

[Bilbo does the same thing as Nori.]

[Soon, several dwarves are in the armory, and they begin collecting the weapons stored there. Kili struggles under a load of several different weapons, and Thorin hands him another one.]

[Thorin:] “You all right?”

[Kili:] “I can manage. Let’s just get out of here.”

[Thorin looks at Kili, then lays another sword on the pile Kili is holding. Kili begins walking down the stairs, but his wounded leg gives way and he falls with a cry. The weapons make a terrible clanging noise, and the dwarves both inside and outside look around warily. In the distance, the watchmen cry out, and running footsteps approach.]

[Dori:] “Run!”

[The dwarves still outside begin to run, but are stopped by two watchmen pointing pikes at them. Bilbo and the dwarves in the armory grab weapons, but several other guards point pikes at them too. Braga, the captain of the guard, is holding Kili with a dagger to his throat. Kili looks sadly and guiltily at Thorin.]

[Alfrid pokes his head out of the door to the Master’s mansion to see the commotion. He sees the soldiers dragging the dwarves to the mansion, with multitudes of townspeople following behind. It is snowing a little.]

[Dwalin:] “Get off of me!”

[Lots of indistinct muttering and yelling. Alfrid closes the door and goes to get the master. Braga arranges all of the dwarves under guard in the town square before the doors of the mansion. As guards open the doors of the mansion, the Master storms out, still putting on his coat.]

[Master:] “What is the meaning of this?”

[Braga:] “We caught ‘em stealing weapons, sire.”

[Master:] “Ah. Enemies of the state, then.”

[Alfrid:] “This is a bunch of mercenaries if ever there was, sire.”



[Dwalin:] “Hold your tongue. You do not know to whom you speak. This is no common criminal; this is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror!”

[Dwalin gestures at Thorin, and Thorin steps forward. The crowd murmurs in amazement.]

[Thorin:] “We are the dwarves of Erebor.”

[The crowd whispers in shock and recognition, and people crane their heads to see better.]

[Thorin:] “We have come to reclaim our homeland. I remember this town and the great days of old. Fleets of boats lay at harbor, filled with silks and fine gems. This was no forsaken town on a lake! This was the center of all trade in the North.”

[Thorin is speaking earnestly to the crowd, and the people nod in agreement.]

[Thorin:] “I would see those days return. I would relight the great forges of the dwarves and send wealth and riches flowing once more from the halls of Erebor!”

[The people cheer and clap, and the Master looks on, calculating. Suddenly, a voice calls out over the crowd, and Bard strides forward.]

[Bard:] “Death! That is what you will bring upon us. Dragon-fire and ruin. If you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.”



[The people whisper anxiously.]

[Thorin:] “You can listen to this naysayer, but I promise you this; If we succeed, all will share in the wealth of the mountain. You will have enough gold to rebuild Esgaroth ten times over!”

[The people shout in excitement and they applaud. The Master looks on, smiling and nodding at this turn of events.]



[Bard:] “All of you! Listen to me! You must listen! Have you forgotten what happened to Dale?!”

[The people quiet down and shake their heads sadly.]

[Bard:] “Have you forgotten those who died in the firestorm?!”

[The people shout, “No!”] 

[Bard:] “And for what purpose? The blind ambition of a mountain-king so riven by greed, he could not see beyond his own desire!”

[As Bard and Thorin stare at each other angrily, the crowd gets louder, but then the Master steps forth.]

[Master:] “Now, now, we must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame. Let us not forget that it was Girion, Lord of Dale, your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast!”

[The Master points accusingly at Bard, and the crowd begins to clamor. As Bard looks away, Thorin looks at him in shock and anger.]

[Alfrid:] “It’s true, sire. We all know the story: arrow after arrow he shot, each one missing its mark.” 

[Bard looks around as the crowd yells angrily at him. He then strides forward and speaks to Thorin earnestly.]

[Bard:] “You have no right, no right to enter that mountain!”

[Thorin:] “I have the only right.”

[Thorin turns and faces the Master.]

[Thorin:] “I speak to the Master of the men of the Lake. Will you see the prophecy fulfilled? Will you share in the great wealth of our people?”

[The people quietly watch in anticipation.]

[Thorin:] “What say you?”

[The Master thinks for several seconds, then smiles and points his finger at Thorin.]

[Master:] “I say unto you...welcome! Welcome and thrice welcome, King under the Mountain!”

[The Master opens his arms in welcome, and the crowd erupts in cheers. Bard looks on silently.]

[Thorin climbs up a few steps and turns to face the audience; the people hug each other in excitement and joy. Thorin and Bard stare at each other.]



[It is morning in Laketown; the people crowd along the sides of the main channel as a boat is loaded with supplies for the dwarves to take to the mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “You do know we’re one short; where’s Bofur?”

[Thorin:] “If he’s not here, we leave him behind.”

[Balin:] “We have to, if we’re to find the door before nightfall. We can risk no more delays.”

[They march along the pier and the dwarves begin to board the boat. They are fully decked out in armor and regal clothing. Thorin stops Kili before he can get in the boat.]

[Thorin:] “Not you. We must travel with speed, you will slow us down.” 

[Kili smiles, thinking Thorin is joking.]

[Kili:] “What are you talking about? I’m coming with you.”

[Thorin:] “No.”

[Fili, already in the boat, turns and looks at Thorin and Kili.]

[Kili:] “I’m going to be there when that door is opened, when we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin.”

[Thorin:] “Kili, stay here. Rest. Join us when you’re healed.”

[Thorin lays his hand on Kili’s shoulder and smiles at him, but Kili looks shocked and betrayed. Thorin turns to board the boat. Kili turns away. Oin gets out of the boat.]

[Oin:] “I’ll stay with the lad. My duty lies with the wounded.”

[Fili:] “Uncle, we grew up on tales of the mountain. Tales you told us. You can’t take that away from him!”

[On the shore, Oin is examining Kili, but Kili is trying to pull away from him.]

[Thorin:] “Fili.”

[Fili:] “I will carry him, if I must!”

[Thorin:] “One day you will be king, and you will understand. I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one dwarf, not even my own kin.”

[Fili looks at Kili, then steps out of the boat. Thorin tries to stop him.]

[Thorin:] “Fili, don’t be a fool. You belong with the Company.”

[Fili:] “I belong with my brother.”

[Fili pulls away from Thorin and goes to join Kili and Oin.]

[The musicians of Laketown play their instruments as the Master climbs up to a raised platform. He waves, and the people cheer and clap.]

[Further away in a house in the town, a sleeping Bofur is woken up by the sound of the music. He is asleep under a table, and as he jolts upright, he smacks his head on the bottom of the table.]

[Bofur:] “By my beard, is that the time? Oh, ugh.” 

[Bofur scrambles up unsteadily and runs out the door, grabbing a glass of drink on his way. In the background, the Master is addressing the people. Bofur runs as fast as he can toward the crowd.]

[Master:] “...Bring good fortune to all!”

[The Master smiles and waves to the dwarves in the boat as they pull into the canal and begin to paddle away. Kili looks on miserably from the dock. The dwarves in the boat smile, wave, and bow at the cheering people.]

[Dori:] “Goodbye!”

[Bofur pushes his way through the townspeople and reaches the water, only to find the boat of dwarves far off down the canal. He turns and finds Kili, Fili, and Oin.]

[Bofur:] “Ah! So you missed the boat as well?”

[Suddenly, Kili moans in pain and begins to fall over, but Fili catches him.]

[Fili:] “Kili? Kili!”

[Oin tries to examine him.]



[Bard opens his door to find Bofur, Fili, Kili, and Oin on his doorstep.]

[Bard:] “No. I’m done with dwarves. Go away.”

[He tries to slam the door shut, but Bofur stops it with his foot.]

[Bofur:] “No, no, no! No one will help us; Kili’s sick. He’s very sick.”

[Bard sees Kili being supported by Oin and Fili; he looks extremely sick. Bard hesitates.]



[Meanwhile, Bilbo and the rest of the Company are in their boat, heading across the lake toward the Lonely Mountain. As the other dwarves row, Thorin stands at the bow of the boat, facing ahead. They are all decked out in regal clothes and armor from Laketown.]

[They climb the foothills of the mountain. At one point, Thorin, recognizing the landscape, runs atop an embankment overlooking a valley. As the other dwarves join him, they look at the other end of the valley and see the ruins of Dale.]



[Bilbo:] “What is this place?”

[Balin:] “It was once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin. The desolation of Smaug.”



[Thorin:] “The sun will soon reach midday; let’s find the hidden door into the mountain before it sets. This way!”

[Bilbo:] “Wait...is this the overlook? Gandalf said to meet him here. On no account were we-”

[Thorin interrupts him abruptly.]

[Thorin:] “Do you see him? We have no time to wait upon the wizard. We’re on our own.”

[Thorin turns and walks away.]

[Thorin:] “Come.”

[The other dwarves follow him; Bilbo looks back at the city, conflicted.]



[Radagast and Gandalf approach the bridge to Dol Guldur.]

[Gandalf:] “Dol Guldur. The hill of sorcery.” 

[Radagast:] “It looks completely abandoned.”

[Gandalf:] “As it is meant to. A spell of concealment lies over this place, which means our enemy is not yet ready to reveal himself. He has not regained his full strength. Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel. Tell her we must force his hand.”

[Radagast:] “What do you mean?”

[Gandalf:] “I’m going in alone. On no account come after me. Do I have your word?”

[Radagast slowly walks away as Gandalf speaks.]

[Radagast:] “Yes, yes, yes, yes.”

[As Radagast prepares to leave, Gandalf begins striding across the bridge toward Dol Guldur. Radagast suddenly turns around and calls to Gandalf.]

[Radagast:] “Wait, Gandalf! What if it’s a trap?”



[Gandalf:] “Turn around, and do not come back.”

[Radagast turns and walks away, and Gandalf speaks quietly so that Radagast cannot hear.]

[Gandalf:] “It’s undoubtedly a trap.”



[Gandalf draws his sword, then, with his sword in one hand and staff in the other, he strides across the bridge.]

[Gandalf is walking through Dol Guldur. It seems abandoned; even the rocks look weathered and broken. Still, there is an air of menace about the place. There are many pieces of sharp metal forged to look like vines of thorns. Gandalf walks into a large open area and begins reciting a spell.]

[Gandalf:] “Cé ná ulco sís nurtaina…I ettuluvas caninye! Cánin i sá tanuvaxe!” [Subtitle: The evil that is hidden here...I command it come forth! I command it reveal itself!]

[With these words, Gandalf strikes his staff on the ground. From the jewel at the top of the staff, an orb of light/energy emanates and moves like a shockwave away, passing through all the matter around Gandalf. This seems to be a spell that reveals hidden evil. However, it reveals nothing yet. Seeing nothing, Gandalf walks to a new place and begins saying the spell again.]

[Gandalf’s voice is heard echoing; Azog listens to it.]

[Azog:] “Zidgu.” [Subtitle: The Wizard has come.]

[Orc:] “Obtoragish gulum-nu. Gimyashim!” [Subtitle: He is lifting the spell. He will find us!]

[Azog:] “Hurnash.” [Subtitle: Yes…he will.]

[We see many Orcs and Wargs with Azog.]



[Thorin stands his sword in the ground and pants. He calls up to the other dwarves, who are all scouring the sides of the Mountain, trying to find the secret entrance.]

[Thorin:] “Anything?”

[Dwalin:] “Nothing!”

[Thorin:] “If the map is true, the hidden door lies directly above us.”

[Bilbo, walking around, sees a massive statue of a dwarf carved into the side of the mountain. Looking closely, he notices a set of stairs built into the statue.]

[Bilbo:] “Up here!”

[Thorin:] “You have keen eyes, Master Baggins.”



[They painstakingly make their way up the steep and treacherous steps and find a little rock-walled clearing in the side of the mountain. Thorin runs to the clearing.]

[Thorin:] “This must be it. The hidden door.”

[The remaining dwarves and Bilbo come into the clearing as well.]

[Thorin:] “Let all those who doubted us rue this day!”

[As Thorin holds up his key, the others cheer.]

[Dwalin:] “Right. We have our key, which means that somewhere, there is a keyhole.”

[He begins exploring the walls of the clearing with his fingers, looking for a keyhole. Thorin walks to the edge of the clearing and looks out at the setting sun.]

[Thorin:] “The last light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the keyhole.”

[Thorin looks at the wall and tries to figure out what the light hitting the wall means. As the sun gets lower and lower on the horizon and nothing changes on the wall, Thorin begins to get frantic.]

[Thorin:] “Nori.”

[Nori, who is known as a thief, runs to the wall and begins tapping it in different places with a spoon while holding his ear to a cup held against the wall. Meanwhile, Dwalin strains and pushes against the wall. The sun gets lower.]

[Thorin:] “We’re losing the light.”

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[Dwalin begins kicking at the wall.]

[Nori:] “Be quiet! I can’t hear when you’re thumping.”

[Dwalin:] “I can’t find it...it’s not here! It’s not here.”

[As the sun gets closer to disappearing, Thorin frantically gestures to the other dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Break it down!”

[Dwalin, Gloin, and Bifur smash at the wall with their weapons, to no avail.]

[Thorin:] “Come on!“

[Balin:] “It’s no good! The door’s sealed. It can’t be opened by force. Powerful magic on it.”

[The dwarves hitting the door drop their weapons in tiredness and disapointedness. The sun disappears behind distant mountains.]

[Thorin:] “No!”

[Thorin stumbles forward and re-examines the old map, reading aloud.]

[Thorin:] “The last light of Durin’s Day will shine upon the keyhole. That’s what it says.”

[He holds his arms open is disbelief; the other dwarves mutter in disappointment and anger.]

[Thorin:] “What did we miss?”

[Thorin walks up to Balin and repeats his question, earnestly and tearfully.]

[Thorin:] “What did we miss, Balin?”

[Balin:] “We’ve lost the light. There’s no more to be done. We had but one chance.”

[The dwarves bow their heads in despair and turn back toward the stairs.]

[Balin:] “Come away; it’s...it’s over.”

[Bilbo:] “Wait a minute!”

[Gloin:] “You wait.”

[Bilbo:] “Where are they going? You can’t give up now!”

[Bilbo looks beseechingly at Thorin, but Thorin turns away. He holds up his key and looks at it, then drops it to the ground, where it clatters.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin...you can’t give up now.”

[But Thorin throws the map at Bilbo’s chest and walks past him. The dwarves begin descending down the stairs, but Bilbo stays in the clearing. He recites the riddle from the map to himself while gesturing with his hands.]

[Bilbo:] “Stand by the grey stone...”

[He goes and stands by the grey wall.]

[Bilbo:] “When the thrush knocks...”  

[He looks around but doesn’t see a thrush anywhere.]

[Bilbo:] “The setting sun...and the last light of Durin’s Day will shine. Hmm. The last light. Last light…”

[He turns away from the wall, thinking hard and muttering to himself. With a thought, he looks up and sees the clouds move aside to reveal the moon. He looks at it wonderingly and sees that it illuminates the clearing. Hearing a noise, he turns back and sees a thrush hitting a snail against the grey wall. Just then, the moonlight hits the wall.]
 


[As the thrush flies away, Bilbo laughs with relief and delight and points at the wall.]

[Bilbo:] “The last light!”

[The moonlight illuminates a keyhole in the rock, and Bilbo gasps in surprise, then yells for the dwarves, who have already gone, to hear. He peers over the edge of the clearing at the stairs, but sees no sign of the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “The keyhole! Come back! Come back! It’s the light of the moon, the last moon of autumn! Ha ha ha!”

[He then begins looking around on the ground.]

[Bilbo:] “Where’s the- Where’s the key? Where’s the- it was here…but it was here, it was here! It was just…”

[Bilbo is looking frantically around on the ground in the clearing for the key, suddenly, his foot hits it and it goes flying from the clearing. Just before it falls off the side of the mountain, a boot steps on the string and stops it. It is Thorin. Bilbo sighs in relief. Thorin slowly reaches down and picks up the key, then examines it. The other dwarves step up beside him. They all smile in relief at Bilbo.]



[Thorin inserts the key into the keyhole and turns it; mechanisms are heard turning behind the rock. Thorin pushes the wall, and a previously unseen door opens into the mountain. The seams of the door were completely invisible earlier. The door opens into a tunnel going into the mountain. The dwarves look on it awe as Thorin stands on the threshold.]

[Thorin:] “Erebor.”

[Balin:] “Thorin…”

[Balin chokes up, and Thorin puts a hand on his shoulder. Thorin then steps into the mountain.]

[Thorin:] “I know these walls…these walls, this stone. You remember it, Balin. Chambers filled with golden light.”

[As he says this, Thorin runs his hands over the walls, lost in memory. Balin steps into the tunnel.]

[Balin:] “I remember.”

[The rest of the Company slowly and reverently enters the mountain. Inside, Nori points at a carving in the wall above the door; it is of the throne of Erebor, with the Arkenstone above it, sending out rays of light in all directions. Gloin reads aloud the inscription on the carving.]

[Gloin:] “Herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin’s Folk. May the heart of the mountain unite all dwarves in defense of this home.”

[Bilbo looks at the carving in interest and curiosity. Balin explains it to him.]

[Balin:] “The throne of the king.”

[Bilbo:] “Oh. And what’s that above it?”

[Balin:] “The Arkenstone.”

[Bilbo:] “Arkenstone….And what’s that?”

[Thorin:] “That, Master Burglar, is why you are here.”  

[All the dwarves look at Bilbo, and he looks bewildered, but resolute.]



[In Bard’s house, Kili is laying on a bed and moaning and straining in pain. His face is covered in sweat.]

[Kili:] “Ah! Ugh! Argh!”

[As he continues moaning, Bofur fills a bowl with hot water and rushes to him.]

[Fili:] “Can you not do something?”

[Oin:] “I need herbs, something to bring down his fever.”

[Bard searches through his bag of medicines.]

[Bard:] “I have nightshade, feverfew…”

[Oin:] “They’re no use to me. Do you have any Kingsfoil?”

[Bard:] “No, it’s a weed. We feed it to the pigs.” 

[Bofur:] “Pigs? Weed? Right.”

[Bofur points at Kili.]

[Bofur:] “Don’t move.”

[Bofur then runs out of the house in search of pigs and Kingsfoil.]



[Balin and Bilbo walk into a tunnel leading to the interior of the mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “You want me to find a jewel?”

[Balin:] “A large white jewel, yes.”

[Bilbo:] “That’s it? Only, I imagine there’s quite a few down there.”

[Balin:] “There is only one Arkenstone. You’ll know it when you see it.”

[Bilbo:] “Alright.”

[Balin begins to walk back down the tunnel, but then pauses.]

[Balin:] “In truth, lad, I do not know what you will find down there. You needn’t go if you don’t want to, there’s no dishonor in turning back.”

[Bilbo:] “No, Balin, I promised I would do this, and I think I must try.”

[Balin looks at Bilbo, then begins to chuckle appreciatively.]

[Balin:] “It never ceases to amaze me.”

[Bilbo:] “What’s that?”

[Balin:] “The courage of Hobbits. Go now with as much luck as you can muster.”

[They nod at each other, and Bilbo proceeds down the tunnel while Balin turns back.]

[Balin:] “Oh, and Bilbo...if there is, in fact, a live dragon down there, don’t waken it.” 

[Bilbo looks worried, but nods. He walks a few more steps, then turns as if to ask a question, but Balin is already disappearing around a corner. Bilbo tiptoes toward Smaug’s lair.]





[In Dol Guldur, it is getting dark, and Gandalf continues searching the ruins. He passes several hanging metal cages full of spikes, each with a skeleton chained inside.]

[Gandalf:] “Cé ná ulco sís nurtaina…I ettuluvas caninye! Cánin i sá tanuvaxe!”

[He walks out onto an open platform and shouts his spell, then strikes his staff against the ground. The concealment-revealing energy bubble expands around him, and it reveals Azog leaping at Gandalf with his mace raised. Gandalf only has the time to raise his sword and staff before Azog strikes him with his mace, sending Gandalf and his weapons flying. Gandalf lies on the ground, and multitudes of now-revealed Orcs stand behind Azog. Azog laughs evily.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You have come too late, Wizard! It is done.]

[Azog raises his mace and swings to finish Gandalf off, with some of his Orcs running up as well, but Gandalf manages to scramble up with his staff and point it at Azog. The staff causes some sort of invisible barrier which stops Azog in his tracks.]

[Gandalf:] “Where is your master?”

[Azog roars and runs at Gandalf again, but Gandalf’s staff stops him and the Orcs behind him.]

[Gandalf:] “Where is he??”

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: He is everywhere. We are legion!]

[Gandalf backs into the corner of the platform; while holding Azog at bay with his staff, Gandalf looks at the lower lowers of Dol Guldur behind him and sees hordes of Orcs and Wargs below, all armed for war.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: It is over.]

[As Azog raises his mace, Gandalf shouts and swings his staff. There is a blinding flash of light and a thunderclap. When Azog and his Orcs open their eyes, Gandalf has disappeared, but they hear his footsteps running away.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Run him down.]

[Gandalf runs the ruins as Orcs on Wargs chase him. He runs out of a building onto a bridge and strikes the building with his staff, causing parts of it to crumble and fall down, crushing the Wargs on his tail and destroying the bridge.]



[In the distance, Azog roars. Gandalf continues running, and he is running out onto a larger bridge when suddenly, a voice sounds out of the darkness.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: There is no light, Wizard…]

[Gandalf stops short as a massive cloud of shadow appears on the bridge in front of him. It is the Necromancer.]

[Necromancer:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: ...that can defeat darkness.]

[Gandalf raises his staff and forms a protective spherical shield of light around himself, about 60 meters in diameter. Tendrils of shadow try to pierce the shield, but cannot. As the shadow continues pounding at the shield, Gandalf struggles, and the shield grows smaller. Gandalf yells, and the shield grows larger again. However, the shadow grows even stronger, strong enough to disintegrate the bridge in front of Gandalf’s shield. The shield grows smaller and smaller, until it is barely bigger than Gandalf. Gandalf opens his eyes in shock, and his shield completely disappears, and he is pushed back. The shadow rushes at him, but he manages to form his shield again. He falls onto his knees, holding his staff above his head, and the shield continues to grow and shrink. Finally, the shadow pushes so hard that Gandalf’s shield collapses, and he falls back.]



[The shadow turns into a wreath of flames, and Gandalf holds his staff above his head with both hands. The flames turn into the slit pupil of an eye, then slowly take the form of a tall man, wearing armor, and with a helmet shaped like spikes. It is Sauron. As Sauron approaches Gandalf, Gandalf’s staff burns and disintegrates away to nothing. The shadows pick Gandalf up into the air and then slam him down on the stones. They then hurl him into a wall and hold him there. The wall around him crumbles and falls in the presence of Sauron. Sauron looks at Gandalf, and the flames around him seem to explode, forming the Eye of Sauron with his body at the center like an iris. Gandalf, recognizing the Necromancer for what it really is, moans out his name, while his face is covered with burns.]

[Gandalf:] “Sauron.”



[The camera zooms into Sauron’s eye, in which is another flaming eye with Sauron’s body in the middle, and we zoom into this eye, and its eye, and so on. Gandalf is knocked out by the hypnotic illusion.]

 

[Bilbo quietly walks through a large doorway and finds himself in a massive hall. He whispers out loud.]

[Bilbo:] “Hello?”

[He knocks quietly on the wall beside him, but the sound is intensified loudly as it echoes, and he jumps and presses himself against the wall in shock. Seeing no reaction to the noise, he walks out into the hall on an elevated walkway.]

[Bilbo:] “You’re not at home. Not at home. Good. Good, good, good.”

[Bilbo, at the top of a staircase, suddenly stops walking and his mouth hangs open in shock. He sees mountains of gold, jewels, weapons, cups, and all sorts of treasure piled dozens of feet high all throughout the immensely massive hall.]



[Bilbo climbs down the stairs and carefully begins to walk atop the treasure. He tries to be quiet, but the coins and jewels beneath his feet make a lot of noise. He pokes around, looking for the Arkenstone. He finds a large white jewel and examines hit.]

[Bilbo:] “What’s that?”

[He shakes the jewel and continues examining it; deciding that it’s not the Arkenstone, he carelessly throws it aside, then jumps when it clatters and makes a lot of noise.]

[Bilbo:] “Sushh, sushh.”

[He continues to look around.]

[Bilbo:] “Arkenstone, Arkenstone...a large, white jewel. Very helpful.”

[Bilbo is surrounded by so much treasure that it would be impossible for him to find one particular jewel out of all of it.]

[Bilbo climbs up a mountain of gold. He picks up a golden cup, and this action starts a small avalanche of coins. Bilbo looks up and sees the coins falling away to reveal Smaug’s eye, which is shut. Bilbo jumps behind a stone pillar in fright. All is silent, and it seems like Smaug is still asleep. Suddenly, Smaug snorts, and the treasure around his nose falls away, revealing it. Bilbo, panting, slowly tries to make his way down the pile of gold, but stops short when he realizes that Smaug’s body is buried in a large circle around where he is standing. The gold all along Smaug’s body begins to ripple as he awakens.]



[Bilbo takes a few steps, then pauses and kneels as Smaug begins to raise his head, his eye still closed. As Smaug opens his eye, Bilbo runs and dives behind a pile of gold.]

[As Smaug’s eye looks around, Bilbo reaches into his pocket and pulls out the Ring. He looks at it for several seconds, then looks up as Smaug begins to raise his head. He puts the Ring on, and becomes invisible. Smaug raises his head and sniffs the air.]

[Smaug:] “Well, thief, I smell you. I hear your breath. I feel your air. Where are you?”

[As Smaug says this, he moves his head back and forth around the place where Bilbo is invisibly standing, and Bilbo has to duck to avoid being knocked over.]



[Bilbo panics and runs down the mountain of treasure. Even though he is invisible, Smaug can see where he is going because of the coins he’s dislodging with his feet while running. Smaug follows rapidly. Bilbo ducks behind a stone outcropping as Smaug continues searching.]

[Smaug:] “Come now, don’t be shy. Step into the light. Mmm, there is something about you, something you carry. Something made of gold, but far more...PRECIOUSSSSS.”

[While saying this, Smaug’s head is right in front of Bilbo’s hiding place. As Smaug says “Precious,” the word reverberates in Bilbo’s head over and over and he strains in mental pain. A flaming eye bursts into his vision, and he yanks the Ring off, becoming visible to Smaug.]

[Smaug:] “There you are, thief in the shadows.”

[Bilbo:] “I did not come to steal from you, O Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy. I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence, to see if you really were as great as the old tales say. I did not believe them.

[Hearing this, Smaug stomps several yards away and draws himself up so his entire body is visible to Bilbo. He is a massive dragon with two back legs,two massive, bat-like wings with claws, and both his neck and tail are incredibly long. His head alone is the size of a school bus.]

[Smaug:] “And, do you you now?!!!”

[Bilbo:] “Truly, the tales and songs fall utterly short of your enormity, O Smaug the Stupendous.”
 
[Smaug:] “Do you think flattery will keep you alive?”

[Bilbo:] “No- no, no.”

[Smaug:] “No, indeed. You seem familiar with my name, but I don’t remember smelling your kind before. Who are you, and where do you come from, may I ask?”

[Smaug snakes his head closer to Bilbo as he asks this. Bilbo opens his mouth to speak but then suddenly sees something off to the side. It is the Arkenstone; a small, white gem glowing with an unnatural light, buried under one layer of coins.]

[Bilbo:] “I- I come from under the hill.”

[Smaug:] “Underhill?”

[Bilbo nods, and sneaks a peek at the Arkenstone. It is not far away from him.]

[Bilbo:] “And under hills and over hills my path has led. And, and, through the air. I am he who walks unseen.”

[Smaug:] “Impressive. What else do you claim to be?”

[Smaug snakes his head forward until his teeth are inches from Bilbo’s face. As Smaug exhales, Bilbo grimaces at his breath.]

[Bilbo:] “I am...luck-wearer. Riddle-maker.”

[Smaug:] “Lovely titles; go on.”

[Bilbo:] “Barrel-rider.”

[Smaug:] “Barrels? Now that is interesting. And what about your little dwarf friends? Where are they hiding?”

[Bilbo:] “Dw- Dwarves? No, no, no dwarves here. You’ve got that all wrong.”

[Smaug:] “Oh, I don’t think so, barrel-rider. They sent you in here to do their dirty work while they skulk about outside.”

[Bilbo:] “Truly, you are mistaken, O Smaug, Chiefest and Greatest of calamities.”

[Smaug:] “You have nice manners...for a thief and a liar! I know the smell and taste of dwarf. No one better. It is the gold! They are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.”

[As Smaug stomps about, his claws knock the Arkenstone away from where it had been, and Bilbo gasps. The Arkenstone bounces down the mountain, and Bilbo runs after it.]

[Smaug:] “Did you think I did not know this day would come, when a pack of canting dwarves would come crawling back to the mountain?!”

[Bilbo trips and slides down the gold. Smaug follows after him, knocking over as massive stone pillar in his rage. As the pillar falls, its reverberations sound throughout the mountain. Even the dwarves sitting in the clearing above the secret stairs hear it and stand up.]

[Dori:] “Was that an earthquake?”

[Balin:] “That, my lad...was a dragon.”

[Thorin looks worried.]



[The reverberation reaches as far as Laketown; in Bard’s house, everyone looks up at the sound, and dust falls from the ceiling. Kili is still moaning in pain.]

[Sigrid:] “Da?”

[Bain:] “It’s coming from the mountain.”

[Fili leaves Kili’s side and approaches Bard.]

[Fili:] “You should leave us. Take your children; get out of here.”

[Bard:] “And go where? There is nowhere to go.”

[Tilda:] “Are we going to die, Da?”

[Bard:] “No, darling.”

[Tilda:] “The dragon, it’s going to kill us.”



[Bard looks at his children worriedly for a moment, then reaches up and pulls a black arrow, the last of the three that Girion had in Dale, from where it had been hidden as a drying rack for plants. His children look at the arrow in shock.]

[Bard:] “Not if I kill it first.”



[Smaug:] “The King under the mountain is dead. I took his throne.”

[Smaug looks for Bilbo, and Bilbo burst out of a pile of gold beneath Smaug’s claw. Bilbo runs down a staircase, and leaps off the side as Smaug’s head swings at him.]  

[Smaug:] “I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.”

[As the Arkenstone bounces rapidly down the mountain of gold, Bilbo slides rapidly after it with Smaug in pursuit.]

[Smaug:] “I kill where I wish, when I wish. My armor is iron.”

[The Arkenstone and Bilbo slide under a covered stone structure; Smaug opens his wings and glides down to land atop the structure.]

[Smaug:] “No blade can pierce me!”



[In Laketown, Bard and Bain sneak through the town. Bard is holding the arrow. Bard look around a corner to check whether all is clear.]

[Bard:] “Alright.”

[Bain:] “A black arrow? Why did you never tell me?”

[Bard:] “Because you did not need to know.”

[They duck behind a wall as soldiers pass by. Bard puts his arm on Bain’s shoulder and indicates the tower with the dwarvish wind-lance on top.]



[Bard:] “Listen to me carefully: I need you to distract the guards. Once I’m at the top of the tower, I’ll set the arrow to the bow.” 

[Just then, Braga and the other soldiers, who have been sent to find Bard, see him]

[Braga:] “There he is! Bard! After him!”

[Bard:] “Quickly! Down there! Go!”

[Bard and Bain run from the soldiers.]

[Braga:] “Stop him!”

[Bard and Bain run through shop and docks, knocking over various items in their way. The soldiers follow, yelling “Stop him!” The shopkeepers yell angrily at both parties. When they have put some distance in front of the guards, Bard stops Bain and hands him the black arrow.]

[Bard:] “Bain! Bain. Keep it safe. Don’t let anyone find it. I’ll deal with them.”

[Bain:] “I won’t leave you!”

[Bard:] “Go!”

[As Bain runs off, Bard turns and faces Braga, who has just caught up to him.]

[Bard:] “Braga.”

[Braga:] “You are under arrest.”

[Bard:] “On what charge?”

[Braga:] “Any charge the Master chooses.”

[Bard turns and sees that he is surrounded. He then turns back and suddenly punches Braga in the face, then punches his way through the soldiers and runs with the soldiers in pursuit. Bain, seeing the soldiers chase his father, jumps into a boat and hides the arrow beneath some ropes and fishing gear.]

[Bard runs through the town; he leaps across a channel using boats as stepping stones. He uses his momentum to cause the last boat to slide several feet across the water until he can step onto the opposite bank. A soldier trying to follow him slips and falls out of a boat into the water. Bard runs down an alley, but a foot is suddenly stuck out of a doorway and Bard trips over it, falling into a pile of wood. As he sits up, dazed, Alfrid steps forward, followed by the Master. As Bard struggles to get up, the Master lifts a wooden pole and hits Bard in the head with it, knocking him out.]



[The dwarves in the clearing on the mountain see an orange glow from the mountain coming through the door.]

[Ori:] “What about Bilbo?”

[Thorin:] “Give him more time.”

[Balin:] “Trying to do what? To be killed?”

[Thorin:] “You’re afraid.”

[Balin pauses for a moment, then steps up to Thorin.]

[Balin:] “Yes, I’m afraid. I fear for YOU. A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard, a sickness that drove your grandfather mad.”

[Thorin:] “I am not my grandfather.”

[Balin:] “You’re not yourself. The Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there-”

[Thorin:] “I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.”

[Balin looks at Thorin disgustedly.]

[Balin:] “Bilbo. His name is Bilbo.”

[Thorin looks contemplatively out into the night.]



[Smaug is searching for Bilbo, who is hiding under the stone structure.]

[Smaug:] “It’s Oakenshield. That filthy dwarvish usurper! He sent you in here for the Arkenstone, didn’t he?”

[Smaug circles around the structure; Bilbo, hiding beneath it, sees the Arkenstone at the other end of the structure.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, no. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

[Bilbo starts to sneak over to the Arkenstone, but is forced to hide behind a pillar as Smaug looks beneath the structure.]

[Smaug:] “Don’t bother denying it. I guessed his foul purpose some time ago. But it matters not. Oakenshield’s quest will fail. The darkness is coming, it will spread to every corner of the land.”



[At Dol Guldur, Gandalf wakes up and finds himself trapped in one of the spiked, hanging metal cages he had seen before. He is bloodied, bruised, and burned. Hearing a horn, he looks down and sees legions of Orcs and Wargs march out of Dol Guldur, armed and equipped for war.]



[In Laketown, Bolg and his Orcs sneak around on the rooftops, looking for the dwarves.]

[Bolg:] “Shugi Khozd-shrakhun hum. Nuzdidiz.” [Rough translation: The filthy dwarf rats are somewhere here. I can smell them.]



[Bilbo is still hiding behind a pillar.]

[Smaug:] “You have been used, thief in the shadows. You were only ever a means to an end. The coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life and found it worth nothing.”

[Bilbo:] “No. No. No, you’re lying!”

[Smaug:] “What did he promise you? A share of the treasure? As if it was his to give. I will not part with a single coin. Not one piece of it.”

[Bilbo, hearing that Smaug is on top of the structure, seeks the Arkenstone lying a few feet away from the structure and makes a run for it. Smaug sees him and whips his tail, sending Bilbo, the Arkenstone, and gold flying. Bilbo tumbles and lands against a pillar.]

[Smaug:] “My teeth are swords! My claws are spears! My wings are a hurricane!”

[As Smaug displays his wings, Bilbo notices a scale missing on the left side of Smaug’s chest. He whispers to himself.]

[Bilbo:] “So it is true. The black arrow found its mark.”

[Smaug:] “What did you say??”
 
[Bilbo:] “Uh, uh, I was just saying your reputation precedes you, oh Smaug the tyrannical. Truly, you have no equal on this earth.”

[As Bilbo speaks, he slowly backs up. He is standing in a bare, open spot, and Smaug faces him. As he finishes speaking, Bilbo looks down and sees the Arkenstone lying just a few feet from him, and he gazes at it.]

[Smaug:] “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.”

[Bilbo and Smaug face off; Bilbo pants. Then Smaug begins to rear his head.]

[Smaug:] “But I think not. I think our little game ends here. So tell me, thief, how do you choose to die?”

[Smaug’s chest glows with a light from inside, and Smaug’s head streaks forward, jaws open, to eat Bilbo. However, Bilbo puts on his ring and disappears, and Smaug’s jaws close on empty space. Angrily, he raises his head again, and the glow from his chest travels up his neck; roaring, Smaug bellows out a massive wall of flames over the area in which  Bilbo had been standing. Unseen by him, coins on the ground move as an invisible Hobbit runs away and up some stairs. Reaching a hallway, Bilbo exhaustedly pulls of the Ring and continues running. Smaug rages about, blowing fire and destroying pillars. His roars echo in the distance.]



[In Laketown, Bard wakes up in a cell. Braga and his soldiers drink and party nearby. Bard rubs his head as he wakes, then jolts upright when he realizes he is in prison.]

[Bofur runs through Laketown, trying to find Kingsfoil. He smells some flowers on a windowsill and rejects them.]

[Bofur:] “Na.”

[As he continues running about, Bolg and other orcs spie him from a rooftop.]

[Orc:] “Khozd!” [translation: Dwarves!]

[Bolg growls softly. Bofur finds a pig eating some weeds; he yanks it out of the pig’s mouth and examines it, then smiles and turns to get back to Kili. Bolg and his Orcs follow on the rooftops.]

[At Bard’s house, Sigrid leans over the balcony outside the front door, looking for her father. She hears a noise and calls out.]

[Sigrid:] “Da? Is that you, Da?”

[She looks around for Bard but doesn’t look up and see Orcs creeping on the roofs of the neighboring houses. Inside, Oin hears a noise on the roof and looks up. As Sigrid turns to walk back inside, an Orc drops on the balcony behind her. She screams and slams the door, but the Orc stops it with his sword. Hearing the screams, Bain, Tilda, and the dwarves jump up.]

[As Bofur hurries toward Bard’s house, an Orcs leaps at him from above. As the Orc swings its axe, Bofur falls backward and drops the Kingsfoil.]

[At the house, another door opens and and Orc strides inside. Oin throws a stack of plates at its head, but another Orc breaks through the roof and falls into the house. The first orc at the door swings at Sigrid, at she falls backward onto the table benches. She slides under the table and pulls the bench sideways next to her as a shield. Fili grapples with an Orc. As another orc falls in through the roof, Tilda throws a plate at it, then Sigrid pulls her under the table as well.]

[Sigrid:] “Get down!”

[An orc threatens Bain, and Bain pushes the bench at it, knocking it over. Bain then grabs the end of the bench and throws it up, hitting the Orc in the head. More orcs jump in through the roof, and one approaches Kili, who is lying in bed.]

[Bofur tries to crawl away, but the Orc grabs him by the legs and pulls him back, then throws him onto a table which tips and causes Bofur to roll away. The orc raises its sword to cut Bofur down, but is suddenly skewered by an arrow through its chest. It falls over dead.]

[In the house, the girls scream as an Orc flips over the table they were hiding under. Another Orc leaps to the balcony in front of the house, but suddenly, Tauriel appears and stabs it in the throat with her knife. She pulls out her other knife as well, and begins killing the Orcs in the house. Legolas jumps in through one of the holes in the roof. He too begins killing Orcs. An Orc approaches Kili and grabs him by the wounded leg. As Kili screams in pain, Tauriel throws her knife and it plunges into the Orc’s throat. Legolas and Tauriel slay Orcs left and right. As an Orc runs at them, Fili grabs Bain and forces him down.]

[Fili:] “Get down!”

[Tauriel kills the Orc, then turns to kill another one. Kili stabs the Orc as well with the knife Tauriel had thrown earlier, and they together kill the Orc. But then, Kili falls over onto the floor, howling in pain, and Tauriel looks at him in worry.]

[An Orc, Bolg’s lieutenant, flees from the house and jumps over the balcony, landing in a boat in the water below. He yells to Bolg, who is striding toward the house.]

[Orc:] “Ekinskeld. Obguranid!” [Subtitle: Oakenshield has gone!]

[Bolg:] “Gur! Arangim!” [Subtitle: Fall back! Regroup at the bridge!]

[The remaining Orcs join him.]

[In the house, Legolas stabs an Orc and trips it, and it falls backward over the balcony railing and lands in the boat below. The boat acts like a seesaw and sends Bolg’s lieutenant orc, who had jumped into the boat earlier, flying up into the air, where Legolas slices off its head with his knives. As the orc’s body falls into the water below, its head still looks at Legolas. Legolas releases the head and it falls. Legolas looks and sees the remaining Orcs running through Laketown after Bolg.]



[Bofur dazedly gets up and sees the Kingsfoil lying in front of him.]

[In the house, Bain speaks to Tauriel amazedly.]

[Bain:] “You killed them all.”

[Legolas:] “There are others. Tauriel, come.”

[Legolas strides toward the door. Tauriel, who had been looking after Kili, looks up. Kili is on the ground, and Oin examines him.]

[Oin:] “We’re losing him!”

[Tauriel, looking shocked, looks at Kili, then at Legolas, who is waiting at the door.]

[Legolas:] “Tauriel.”

[Legolas looks at her for a moment and then walks out the door. Tauriel remains standing. Legolas jumps over the balcony and onto a bridge, then begins running. Tauriel looks away and begins to head out the door to follow Legolas. Just as she reaches the door, Kili moans in pain, and Tauriel turns to look at him. Legolas catches up to the Orcs and shoots one at point blank; the arrow goes all the way through its head and into the wood planking behind. Tauriel looks after Legolas, then at Kili again. Hearing a noise, Tauriel grabs her knives, then sees Bofur running up with the Kingsfoil. Her eyes open in shock and she takes the leaves from Bofur’s stunned grasp.]

[Tauriel:] “Athelas.”

[She reverently examines it.]

[Tauriel:] “Athelas…”

[Bofur:] “What are you doing…?”

[Tauriel:] “I’m going to save him.”



[In the mountain, Thorin has decided to save Bilbo. He charges with his sword out through the tunnels, and stops as flames light up the walls of the tunnel. He runs out onto the same overhang Bilbo had earlier reached, then stops abruptly when he sees the mountain of treasure all around him. He breathes heavily. Just then, Bilbo runs up to him.]

[Thorin:] “You’re alive!”

[Bilbo:] “Not for much longer!”

[Thorin:] “Did you find the Arkenstone?”

[Bilbo:] “The dragon’s coming!”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone!”

[They are both standing at the entrance to the tunnel, but Thorin is blocking Bilbo’s way. They pause and look at each other for several seconds, then Thorin speaks again, more quietly.]

[Thorin:] “Did you find it?”

[They stare at each other for several seconds, panting heavily.]

[Bilbo:] “No. We have to get out.”

[Bilbo tries to enter the tunnel, but Thorin swings his sword across it, blocking the entrance. He presses the blade against Bilbo, and Bilbo stumbles back, the sword still touching him. Bilbo and Thorin face each other, with the tip of Thorin’s sword against Bilbo’s chest.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin. Thorin!”

[Thorin steps forward, forcing Bilbo to step back. Bilbo’s eyes are open in fear, and Thorin’s face is steel and blank of emotion. Suddenly, Bilbo looks off to the side, and Thorin hears a sound in that direction. He turns and sees Smaug approaching over the mountain of treasure. Smaug, recognizing Thorin, snarls. Suddenly, the remaining dwarves run out of the tunnel and face Smaug, their weapons out. Smaug roars and rushes at them; his chest and neck glow orange.]

[Smaug:] “You will burn!”

[Just as Smaug bellows fire at them, the dwarves and Bilbo turn and jump off the staircase. They tumble down the pile of treasure and land near the entrance to another tunnel, which they run into.]

[Dori:] “Come on, Bilbo!”

[Angrily, Smaug breathes fire in all directions. Thorin, the last one in the door, is pushed in by the force of the flames. He runs into the room at the other end of the tunnel with the back of his coat on fire, and he throws himself on the ground and rolls to extinguish the flames. He jumps back up.]

[Thorin:] “Come on.”

[With Smaug roaring in the background, they run.]



[At Bard’s house, Tauriel washes and tears apart the Kingsfoil in a tub of water held by Tilda. Fili, Oin, and Bofur pick up a moaning Kili and lay him on the table and try to hold him down.]

[Tauriel:] “Hold him down.”

[She approaches with the bowl of water and examines Kili’s wound. Seeing how black and festered it is, she looks away in worry. As the others look on, Tauriel closes her eyes and begins chanting in Elvish while she kneads the soaked Kingsfoil in her hand, then presses it to Kili’s wound.]

[Tauriel:] “Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin, hon leitho o ngurth.” [Rough translation: May the blessing that was given to me be sent from me to him, may he be released from death.]

[Kili screams and thrashes in pain, and Sigrid jumps in to help hold him down. She calls her sister to come help as well.]

[Sigrid:] “Tilda!”

[Tauriel continues chanting; Fili looks at her strangely, and Oin listens in amazement through his fairly dented hearing trumpet. Kili begins calming down. In his hearing, it seems as though Tauriel’s voice has become echoing and all-encompassing. To his vision, she appears to start glowing like a star. He stares at her, glassy-eyed.]



[In Erebor, everything is quiet and dark. There is no sign of either the dragon or the dwarves. Suddenly, there are footsteps. The dwarves emerge out of a tunnel and approach a stone bridge over a chasm. Thorin raises his hand and quiets the group.]

[Thorin:] “Shh. Shh.”

[Dori:] “Quiet.”

[They near the foot of the bridge and Thorin peers around the edge of the tunnel, looking for any sign of Smaug. They all whisper.]

[Dori:] “We’ve given him the slip.”

[Dwalin:] “No, he’s too cunning for that.”

[Bilbo:] “So where to now?”

[Thorin:] “The western guardroom. There may be a way out.”

[Balin:] “It’s too high. There’s no chance that way.”

[Thorin:] “It’s our only chance. We have to try.”

[Quietly, they tiptoe across the bridge, looking all about. Suddenly, a coin falls to the floor right in front of Bilbo and rings loudly. They all freeze and look at Bilbo, who frantically checks his jacket to see if some coin had been stuck in a fold. Hearing another coin fall, they look up and see Smaug crawling just above them, looking for them. He hasn’t seen them. The coins that fell came from his chest and arms, where several coins and gems have embedded themselves after years of him sleeping on them. Thorin motions for them to keep moving.]



[At Bard’s house, Tauriel binds Kili’s leg with a clean cloth. Kili lies on the table with his head in a basket of walnuts. Oin and Fili are in the kitchen, watching a pot of water boil.]

[Oin:] “I’ve heard tell of the wonders of elvish medicine. That was a privilege to witness.”

[Kili slightly opens his eyes and looks at Tauriel.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel.”

[Tauriel:] “Lie still.”

[Kili:] “You cannot be her.”

[Tauriel looks up in confusion.]

[Kili:] “She is far away. Sh- She is far, far away from me, and she walks in starlight in another world.”

[Tauriel looks at Kili.]

[Kili:] “It was just a dream.”

[Kili slowly raises his hand and entwines his fingers with Tauriel’s.]

[Kili:] “Do you think she could have loved me?”

[Tauriel is silent for a few moments, then opens her mouth to speak, but the scene cuts before she says anything.]



[In Erebor, the Company runs through a hall and emerge in the western guardroom.]

[Thorin:] “Stay close.”

[They all stop abruptly when they see that the guardroom is full of rotted, dust- and cobweb-covered corpses.]

[Dwalin:] “That’s it, then. There’s no way out.”

[It seems like a landslide or something has blocked the exit, trapping the dwarves in the past in the room to die.]

[Balin:] “The last of our kin. They must have come here, hoping beyond hope. We could try to reach the Mines. We might last a few days.”

[Thorin:] “No. I will not die like this. Cowering, clawing for breath. We make for the forges.”

[Dwalin:] “He’ll see us, sure as death.”

[Thorin:] “Not if we split up.”

[Balin:] “Thorin, we’ll never make it.”

[Thorin:] “Some of us might. Lead him to the forges. We kill the dragon. If this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.”

[Thorin, Bilbo, and Balin run out onto the bridge from earlier.]

[Thorin:] “This way!”

[A booming sound comes from nearby, and Smaug appears.]

[Smaug:] “Flee, flee! Run for your lives! There is nowhere to hide.”

[Smaug goes at the three, but he turns at another sound. Dori, Ori, and Bombur are running on another bridge and yelling to distract Smaug.]

[Dori:] “Behind you!”

[Smaug looks at them, then lunges toward them. They turn and run.]

[Dori:] “Come on!”

[As Smaug chases the second group (Dori, Ori, and Bombur), the first group (Thorin, Bilbo, and Balin) continue across the bridge. Suddenly, the third group, Dwalin and Nori, run across another bridge and yell to distract Smaug.]

[Dwalin:] “Hey you! Here!”

[Smaug turns and jumps at them. They run off the bridge and into a tunnel just before Smaug’s claw lands where they were. The fourth group, Gloin and Bifur, use this chance to run across a bridge and make it into a tunnel as well. Angrily, Smaug blows fire after them. He blows rapidly in an arc all around him, into all the tunnels. His fire causes the stones beneath Gloin and Bifur to glow in heat. They reach a cliff and leap into the air, landing in large troughs which they slide down. They land in the buckets of a large hanging conveyor belt system used in the past for mining.]



[In Laketown, Bolg strides across a bridge and issues a command to his Orcs and Wargs who are waiting there.]

[Bolg:] “Zidgar Guldur-nar! Ekinskeld Erebor-nar nakhan!” [Subtitle: Send word to Dol Guldur! Oakenshield has reached the Mountain!]

[Bolg and the Orcs turn when they hear the sound of steel and fighting in the town behind them.]

[The sounds are coming from Legolas, who is still pursuing the Orcs and killing them with his knives.]

[Bolg turns back to the Orcs.]

[Bolg:] “Gur! Abguriz!” [Subtitle: Go! You! Come with me.]

[As the Orcs turn to leave, Bolg and two Orcs stride back toward the town. The remaining Orcs and Wargs gallop across a long bridge connecting Laketown to the mainland.]

[Bolg steps into a long alley just as Legolas enters it from the other side. They glare at each other, and Legolas whips out Orcrist, which he has been carrying at his hip. Holding it in both hands, he advances toward Bolg.]



[As they walk toward each other, the other two Orcs appear out of hiding spots on either side of the alley and attack Legolas. Legolas knocks the two of them down just in time to deflect a blow from Bolg. Legolas fights all three Orcs at once, and when he has knocked down the two again, he stabs at Bolg’s stomach, but Bolg drops his weapon and catches Legolas’s sword between his arm and ribs. He pulls Legolas closer to him using the sword and then throws him against a wooden pillar. Legolas drops the sword. Before he can get up, Bolg grabs him and throws him again, this time into a wall. Bolg strides over and kicks at Legolas, but Legolas manages to grab Bolg’s leg and knock him off balance and into the wall behind him. Legolas leaps in the air and delivers a flying punch to Bolg’s face. He grab’s Bolg and smashes his head repeatedly into the wooden post. He throws Bolg against a wall, but Bolg rebound from the wall and grabs Legolas in a crushing embrace against his chest. He squeezes Legolas and Legolas strains in pain, then jerks his head back into Bolg’s face, forcing him to release him. Legolas manages to pull out a knife and slice Bolg lightly on the stomach, but Bolg grabs him and throws him toward the other two Orcs, who have gotten back up. As Legolas fights the two of them with his knife, Bolg strides away, limping.]

[Legolas dispatches the two Orcs and runs over to where Orcrist is lying on the ground, and he picks it up. As he stands, he falls back against a wall in pain, breathing heavily. His eyes open wide in shock and he raises his hand to his nose. It comes away with blood, and he is shocked. He looks to the side and sees Bolg on a Warg, heading out of the town.]

[Bolg rides across the bridge on his Warg; close behind him is Legolas on a white horse.]



[Balin, Thorin, and Bilbo run through a large hallway. Balin turns into a side tunnel, but Thorin continues forward with Bilbo at his heels.]

[Balin:] “It’s this way! This way! Come on!”

[Bilbo stops by the tunnel, and calls out to Thorin, who is still ahead.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[Thorin turns and begins to go back to Bilbo and Balin, but stops suddenly. They all see Smaug at the end of the hallway. Thorin yells at Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “Follow Balin!”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[Balin:] “Come on!”

[Balin pulls Bilbo into the side tunnel just as Smaug’s chest glows orange and he unleashes his fire throughout the hall. Thorin runs the other way and leaps into the air, falling into a deep pit. He catches onto a chain with a bucket at the end of it, and it begins descending just as Smaug leaps into the pit as well. Smaug claws his way down the tunnel, snapping at Thorin on the chain. Dwalin runs up to the mouth of the pit.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin!”

[Dwalin smashes his axe into the machinery holding the chain Thorin is holding on to, and the chain stops descending abruptly. Beside Dwalin, a heavy holding bucket on the other end of the same chain begins descending rapidly, causing Thorin’s chain to fly upward. Thorin soars upward, narrowly missing Smaug’s head. Smaug turns and manages to grab the end of Thorin’s chain, stopping its movement. Smaug pulls down, at the machinery holding the chain at the top of the pit breaks free of its moorings and falls into the pit. Hit chain slack, Thorin falls and lands right on the tip of Smaug’s closed mouth. He stands on Smaug’s top lip as Smaug growls and opens his mouth; fire is visibly rising up his neck. Just as Smaug snaps closed his mouth to eat Thorin, Thorin leaps to the side and grabs another chain. Smaug turns to bite him, but the falling machinery strikes him in the face. Nori, at the top of the pit, hits another machine, and its gears spin rapidly, pulling Thorin on his chain rapidly upward. Smaug roars and blows smoke straight up the pit after Thorin. Thorin manages to reach the top and throw himself on a ledge just as the fire erupts beside him. He stumbles over to Nori.]

[Thorin:] “Go! Go!”

[Thorin and Nori run through narrow slits between tall, stone pillars and join the other dwarves and Bilbo. They are standing in front of several massive dwarf furnaces, each at least 10 yards high.]

[Dwalin:] “The plan’s not going to work. These furnaces are stone cold.”

[Balin:] “He’s right; there’s no fire hot enough to set them ablaze.”

[The furnaces are all dark, with no sign of fire within. Thorin turns back toward the pit.]

[Thorin:] “Have we not? I did not look to see you so easily outwitted!”

[Smaug’s claw emerges from the pit, his body following it. Thorin continues taunting him.]

[Thorin:] “You have grown slow and fat in your dotage.”

[Smaug snarls at Thorin in anger.]

[Thorin:] “Slug.”

[As Smaug snarls and advances, Thorin gets behind a pillar and yells to the others to do the same.]

[Thorin:] “Take cover. Go!”

[They all rush behind pillars just as Smaug unleashes his flame at them. The fire goes past the pillars and reaches all the way to the furnaces. The dwarves and Bilbo, though not in the direct path of the fire, yell from the pain, heat, and pressure. As Smaug stops, fire suddenly comes out of the bottoms of the furnaces, and they begin glowing and working. Smaug growls in confusion and anger. The dwarves run from the pillars as Smaug begins battering at them with his head. They are immensely strong, like a latticework of metal, but they begin to bend under Smaug’s tremendous strength.]

[Thorin:] “Bombur! Get those bellows working. Go!”

[Bombur:] “Alright!”

[Bombur runs and leaps onto a chain next to a forge. The chain slides down with his weight, and he lands on the handle of a massive bellows. The bellows compress and blast air into the furnace, which exhumes bright blue flames. On top of the furnaces is a massive pile of unrefined gold, at least 10 yards in diameter.]

[Thorin turns and sees the latticework continue to bend from Smaug’s bashing.]

[Thorin:] “Bilbo! Up there, on my mark, pull that lever.”

[He points Bilbo toward a lever high up on a mound, and Bilbo runs toward it. The dwarves run toward the forges as the latticework begins to break. Thorin grabs Balin.]

[Thorin:] “Balin, can you still make some flash-flame?”

[Balin:] “Aye. It’ll only take a jiffy.” 

[Balin grabs some of the other dwarves to help him.]

[Balin:] “Come on!”

[As Balin runs off, Dwalin looks at the latticework, which is bending dangerously from Smaug’s blows.]

[Dwalin:] “We don’t have a jiffy.”

[Under the force of Smaug’s onslaught, the latticework finally gives way and falls to the ground. Smaug storms into the furnace room. He looks about, growling.]





[In a storage room nearby, Balin and some other dwarves frantically mix together various powders into jars to make flash-flame bombs.]

[Balin:] “Where’s the sulfur?” 

[Dori:] “You sure you know what you’re doing?”



[Bilbo clambers up some steps and reaches the lever mounted high on a tower; Smaug begins walking toward him.]

[Balin chuckles as he pours a vial of powder into empty jars.]

[Dori:] “Come on!”

[Smaug walks toward Bilbo.]

[Balin drops some small ball into each jar.]

[Smaug raises his head to look at Bilbo, then looks to the side and sees Thorin standing there. Smaug turns and snarls at Thorin, and Thorin yells to Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “Now!”

[Bilbo jumps into the air and pulls down on the lever just as Thorin lunges toward Thorin. Huge jets of water burst out of carved faces in the wall behind Bilbo and slam into Smaug, knocking him off balance and quenching the flames he was beginning to blow at Thorin. Smaug slides into the side of a furnace from the force of the water, and the glow in his chest disappears. Roaring in rage, Smaug flaps into the air and begins thrashing about madly. The jets of water cause a watermill to begin turning some gears, which causes the various rope conveyor belts to begin operating. Some of them are full of heavy chunks of rock and ore.]

[Bombur continues going up and down on his chain, pumping the bellows and turning the furnace fire blue. Atop the furnaces, the solid impure gold begins to glow and melt. Smaug begins crawling toward Thorin again. Above him, Gloin and Bifur have arrived on the bucket conveyor belt. As Bilbo begins to climb down the mound, Smaug approaches Thorin. Suddenly, there is a flash of blue light on the side of his head. Balin, Ori, and Dori are throwing flash-flame bombs at Smaug. However, Smaug is not at all fazed by them and continues toward Thorin. Above Smaug, Gloin raises his axe and cuts the rope of the conveyor belt full of heavy rocks below him, dropping tons of rocks on Smaug and making him fall to the ground, roaring.]

[The gold atop the furnaces is completely melted now. Thorin runs over to a furnace and pulls on a chain, opening a gate which allows the molten gold to flow out of the furnaces and through troughs built into the ground.]

[Smaug, tangled in the ropes of the conveyor belt, thrashes about and hits the rope of the conveyor belt Gloin and Bifur are in, breaking it and knocking it to the floor.]

[Gloin:] “Noo! Ahhh!”

[They miraculously land on the ground unhurt. Beneath Smaug, rivers of molten gold flow through the troughs on the floor. Thorin turns and begins running, shouting back at the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings!” 

[As Smaug thrashes about, one of the heavy metal buckets tangled on him goes flying toward Bilbo on top of the mound. Bilbo yells and ducks, and the bucket misses him but takes large chunks out of the wall.]

[Thorin grabs a wheelbarrow and runs while pushing it, dodging Smaug’s thrashing limbs. Smaug’s tail smashes into the base of the mound, cracking it and worrying Bilbo. Thorin throws the wheelbarrow into a channel of gold and leaps into the wheelbarrow; it floats on the gold and is carried along. Seeing this, Smaug roars and whips his head around, finally getting rid of the ropes and buckets tangled around him. He stomps over to a small entrance at the base of the mound where all the troughs of liquid gold join and lead out of the room. Before he can get to Thorin, Thorin on his wheelbarrow floats through the entrance, just as the mound collapses and Bilbo falls. He manages to hit the ground rolling. Smaug sees Bilbo and snarls. Thorin turns his head back and yells.]

[Thorin:] “Keep going, Bilbo! Run!”

[Bilbo takes off running with Smaug in pursuit; he leaps onto a large stone slide before Smaug can grab him, and Smaug slides after him, demolishing all the stone structures nearby with his wings.]

[The trough Thorin is floating in ends at a drop; as his wheelbarrow goes over the edge, Thorin leaps from it and grabs onto a chain. The molten gold drops into a large stone mold.]



[Bilbo, running from Smaug, runs through a doorway and into a massive hall adorned with banners hundreds of feet tall.]



[Just as he runs in, the wall above the doorway explodes as Smaug jumps through it. Bilbo runs frantically from the flying rocks, but is caught beneath the cloth of a falling banner and knocked to the floor. Smaug leaps to the floor and shouts angrily.]

[Smaug:] “You think you could deceive me, Barrel-rider?”

[Bilbo peaks out from the edge of the banner.]

[Smaug:] “You have come from Laketown. There is- is some sort of scheme hatched between these filthy dwarves and those miserable cup-trading Lakemen. Those sniveling cowards with their longbows and black arrows!”

[Smaug is talking to himself, and his voice breaks in both anger and fear when he mentions the black arrows.]

[Smaug:] “Perhaps it is time I paid them a visit.”

[Smaug turns to go to Laketown, and Bilbo gasps.]

[Bilbo:] “Oh, no.”

[He scrambles out from under the banner and yells at Smaug.]

[Bilbo:] “This isn’t their fault! Wait! You cannot go to Laketown.”

[Hearing this, Smaug stops for a moment, then turns toward Bilbo, who is running after him.]

[Smaug:] “You care about them, do you? Good. Then you can watch them die.”

[Smaug turns and strides off down the hall. Suddenly, a voice sounds from one end of the hall, where there is a massive stone structure that looks roughly like a dwarf. The voice is Thorin’s; he is standing atop the structure.]

[Thorin:] “Here, you witless worm!”

[Smaug stops in his track, snarling and squinting in anger. He then turns toward Thorin.]

[Smaug:] “You.”

[Thorin:] “I am taking back what you stole.”

[Smaug slowly stalks toward Thorin.]

[Smaug:] “You would take nothing from me, Dwarf. I laid low your warriors of old. I instilled terror in the hearts of men. I am King under the Mountain.”

[His head is level with Thorin now; Bilbo watches from an adjoining hall.]

[Thorin:] “This is not your kingdom. These are dwarf lands, this is dwarf gold, and we will have our revenge.”

[Unseen by Smaug, there are chains attached to various places on the back of the stone dwarf structure Thorin is standing on, and the ends of these chains are held by the other dwarves. As Thorin speaks, Smaug’s chest and neck glow with fire, and Thorin slowly reaches up toward a rope above him. Just as Smaug opens his mouth, Thorin yells something in Khuzdul.]

[Thorin:] “_ _ _” 

[Thorin yanks on the rope, and a pin behind the stone falls out, releasing heavy wooden bands and chains that had been wrapped tightly around the stone. Smaug rears his head in confusion. The other dwarves pull mightily on their chains, and more pins similar to the first are pulled out of the stone. The stone structure, which is now revealed to be the mold into which the liquid gold from earlier poured into, falls apart and reveals a massive statue of a dwarf king, made entirely out of solid gold. Thorin swings away on a rope to escape the falling rocks. Smaug looks at the golden statue, which is even larger than him, in awe and desire. As he approaches it, his mouth opens slightly in greed.]



[Suddenly, the gold around the statue’s eyes warps and then explodes into liquid; the gold in the statue had not yet fully solidified, and the entire statue collapses and explodes into burning hot liquid. Smaug roars in anger as the statue melts, and scrabbles backward to escape the gold. However, he cannot move fast enough and the tidal wave of gold hits him and knocks him over. As he roars, he is entirely smothered and drowned in the gold, which fills the entire hall in a layer several feet deep.]

[The gold settles, and no sign of Smaug is seen. The dwarves begin to smile in joy, but suddenly, the surface of the golden lake explodes as Smaug leaps out. He is entirely covered in gold, and he screams in anger and pain.]

[Smaug:] “Ahh! Revenge?! Revenge! I will show you REVENGE!”

[As the dwarves and Bilbo look on in shock, Smaug runs down the hallway and takes off in flight.]

[Outside the mountain, it is night; we see the great doors of Erebor closed and shut. Suddenly, the side of the mountain breaks as an enraged Smaug smashes his way out. He flaps his wing and lifts off into the sky, spinning and causing the remaining gold on him to fall off in a golden shimmer. He swoops off toward Laketown.]



[In Laketown, people see the fire and light coming from the previously closed gates of Erebor, and they shout and cower in fear. Bard grabs the bars of his cell in shock. In Bard’s house, the dwarves, children, and Tauriel look about in fear.]



[Bilbo runs out of the destroyed gates of Erebor and climbs up some ruins, looking after the flying Smaug. He falls to his knees.]



[Bard yells to Braga and the soldiers, who are partying in their barracks nearby, but they ignore him.]

[Bard:] “Listen to me! You don’t know what is coming!” 



[Smaug soars through the air toward Laketown, talking to himself.]

[Smaug:] “I am fire. I am...DEATH!”



[Watching him fly away, Bilbo despairingly pants and looks on in shock.]

[Bilbo:] “What have we done?”

[The scene fades to black. As the credits roll, Ed Sheeran’s song “I See Fire” plays.]


[Opening scene: We see Laketown, with the Lonely Mountain in the distance. Bells are ringing, and people are frantically loading their possessions into boats. In his house, the Master of Laketown is overseeing his soldiers and servants carrying boxes containing his gold and valuables.]

[Master:] “I warned you. Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with dwarves?! Now they’ve done it! They’ve woken the dragon. They brought the apocalypse upon our heads! Come on! Quickly! Quickly!”

[The Master pulls a candlestick in the wall sideways; it turns out to be a secret lever, and a nearby bookshelf falls backward to reveal a hidden staircase and boat landing with the Master’s boat waiting.]

[Master:] “Faster now! I’m trying to evacuate myself here! Careful, men. Never mind the books! Get on, get the rest of it!”

[Guard #1:] “But Sire, should we not try to save the town?”

[Master:] “The town is lost! Save the gold!”

[Guard #2:] “You heard him.”

[The men load all the gold and other valuables onto the Master’s boat.]



[The townspeople frantically paddle their loaded boats through the canals. Tauriel watches the sky ominously; with her elf-hearing, she can hear Smaug approaching and roaring. Suddenly, a huge shadow swoops overhead. Smaug has arrived.]

[Tauriel enter’s Bard’s house and prepares the dwarves and Bard’s family to leave.]

[Tauriel:] “We have no time. We must leave!”

[Bofur:] “Get him up.”

[Fili:] “Come on, brother.”

[Bofur:] “Come on, come on! Let’s go.”

[Kili:] “I’m fine - I can walk.”

[Tauriel:] “As fast as you can.”

[Bain:] “We’re not leaving. Not without our father.”

[Tauriel:] “If you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want?”



[Bard is in the prison, and all the men guarding him are gone. He clutches the cell bars and shouts.]

[Bard:] “Open the door! Do you hear me!”

[He stops as he sees Smaug flying high above the town, then frantically tries to break the lock. When it doesn’t break, he rushes to the other side of his jail cell, which is on an arch of a building overhanging a canal.] 



[Tauriel, the dwarves, and Bard’s family get on a boat at the back of the house.] 

[Fili:] “Give me your hand.”

[Bofur:] “Come on, we gotta go!”

[Tauriel:] “Quickly now! Hurry!”

[Fili:] “Kili, come on!”

[They set off down the canal, poling the boat through the floating chunks of ice. Smaug swoops low overhead, and the townspeople scream.]

[Smaug soars high above and away from the town, then turns and dives steeply toward the town, building up fire in his chest. As he gets over the town, he unleashes his flames, and he breathes his fire in a line all the way across the town. People scream and fall and die in the inferno.]

[Bard smashes at his cell’s bars with a pail, but to no avail.]

[Smaug breathes fire over another section of the town; a man, on fire, falls out of his house and into the water.]



[The Master, his men, and Alfrid pole their boat loaded with treasure through the water, with Smaug setting things to fire around them.]

[Master:] “Come on! Come on! Faster! FASTER!”

[Master:] “If only we could take more of these poor people with us, but they are hardly-”

[Alfrid:] “-worth it. I quite agree.”

[A man tries to climb onto the boat, but Alfrid kicks him in the face and back into the water.]



[Bard tears his blanket into strips. People are trampling each other in their efforts to escape the dragon and the fire.]

[Bain:] “Look out!”

[The Master’s boat collides with Tauriel’s, upsetting everyone. They manage to push their boats apart, but some of the Master’s treasure falls into the water.]

[Master:] “Move it! Move it! Come on, faster!” 

[Master:] “My gold, my GOLD!”

[Alfrid:] “We’re carrying too much weight. We need to dump something!”

[While Alfrid looks at the pile of treasure, trying to decide what to throw overboard, the Master looks at him greedily.]

[Master:] “You’re quite right, Alfrid.”

[The Master pushes Alfrid overboard, just as a cloth loops falls from above and catches around the Master’s throat. It is the rope Bard made from his blanket; he has tied one end to his cell bars and let the other end, the loop, out of the window and over the canal, where it has conveniently caught the Master. Braga, at the front of the boat, hasn’t seen this.]

[Braga:] “Faster! Faster!”

[As the boat pulls ahead, the rope loops pulls the Master back, but then he gets stuck in front of the boat’s rear post. As the rope tightens around him, he gags and chokes. Eventually, the pressure is so much that the entire side of Bard’s prison break, and Bard escapes. The Master frantically pulls the rope away from his throat.]

[As Smaug flies overhead, still blowing flames, Bard breaks through the guardroom window and grabs his bow and quiver, testing his bowstring. He pushes out some of the shingles in the upper story and clambers out onto the roof, where he has a good vantage point. He ducks low as Smaug flies by almost overhead. Bard runs across the rooftops, heading toward the bell tower, the tallest building in the town.]



[Back at the Lonely Mountain, Thorin and Company watch the town burning in the lake.]

[Balin:] “Poor souls.”

[They all stare at each other in sadness and fear. Bilbo looks back and sees that Thorin is staring back at the halls of Erebor, not at Laketown. Bilbo looks worried.]



[Bard continues leaping roof to roof. Tauriel hides her boat under an overhang until she sees that it’s safe to go on. Bard climbs rapidly up the winding steps of the bell tower. Once at the top, he pulls all the arrows out of his quiver and looks out at the sky. As Smaug soars by, Bard shoots an arrow at him; however, the arrow merely bounces off Smaug’s scales and falls to the ground. Bard, standing directly below the ringing bell, gets nauseated by the booming sound, so he pulls out his dagger and cut’s the bell’s rope, silencing it. He shoots another arrow at Smaug, but this, like the first bounces harmlessly off. In the canals below, Bain, on the boat with his family, the dwarves, and Tauriel, notices his father at the top of the tower.]

[Bain:] “Da!”

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[As they watch, Bard shoots yet another arrow, harmlessly hitting the dragon.]

[Kili:] “He hit it! He hit the dragon!”

[Tauriel:] “No...”

[Kili:] “He did! He hit his mark, I saw!”

[Tauriel:] “His arrows cannot pierce its hide; I fear nothing will.”

[Bain looks down disconsolately, then suddenly looks up and notices the state of the Master of Laketown, and below it, the boat in which he’d hidden the Black Arrow his father had asked him to keep safe. Bain’s face turns to a determined look. As their boat passes under a hanging hook, Bain leaps up and grabs it, swinging clear of the boat. The other grab at him and miss, and they yell after him.]

[Bofur:] “What are you doing?!”

[Fili:] “Come back! Bain, come back!”

[Bain uses the hook and the crane it is attached to to swing to the dock, from where he runs toward the boat with the Black Arrow.]

[Tauriel:] “Leave him! We cannot go back!”

[Tilda:] “Bain!”



[At the top of the tower, Bard reaches for his arrows, only to find one left. He hesitates in fear, then grabs it and shoots Smaug. This time, Smaug passes so close to the tower that the wind knocks Bard over. Smaug howls, feeling the arrow, although it didn’t hurt him. Suddenly, Bain appears at the top of the bell tower, shocking Bard.]

[Bain:] “Dad!”

[Bard:] “Bain?! What are you doing?! Why didn’t you leave?! You were supposed to leave!”

[Bain:] “I came to help you.”

[Bard:] “No! Nothing can stop him now!”

[Bain:] “This might.”

[Bain holds up the Black Arrow. His father gratefully looks at it, then stroke’s Bain’s face.]

[Bard:] “Bain - you go back. You get out of here now!”

[Looking beyond Bard, Bain sees Smaug approaching the tower rapidly, Smaug having determined where the arrows were coming from.]

[Bain:] “DAD!”

[Smaug smashes through the top part of the bell tower. Bard finds himself lying down on the remaining top of the tower.]

[Bard:] “BAIN!”

[Bain is hanging by one arm to the remains of the tower; he has the Black Arrow in the other. Bard grabs Bain’s arm and hauls him back up. Meanwhile, Smaug lands closeby in the town, crushing buildings underneath him. He is directly in the way of the Master’s boat.]

[Master:] “Stop! Stop! Halt! Halt!”

[Bard pulls the Black Arrow out of the hands of the petrified Bain and stands up, facing Smaug. Smaug looks at him.] 

[Smaug:] “Who are you that would stand against me?!”

[Bard grabs his bow, only to find that it was broken in half when Smaug smashed into the tower earlier.]

[Smaug:] “Now that is a pity. What will you do now, Bowman? You are forsaken. No help will come.”

[Bard looks around frantically, but there is nothing to help him. Smaug begins walking toward him, crushing the buildings beneath him. The Master sees his chance and yells to his oarsmen.]

[Master:] “Now’s our chance! Go! Go! Into the open water!”

[Looking at the tower, Smaug growls and licks his lips. He continues speaking to Bard.]

[Smaug:] “Is that your child? You cannot save him from the fire. He will BURN!”

[As Smaug continues to approach, Bard fixes the two broken halves of his bow into the walls of the belltower, with the bowstring taut between them. He fixes the Black Arrow to the bowstring, and lays the front end of the Black Arrow on the shoulder of Bain, who is standing in between the fixed pieces of the bow and facing Bard. Bain pants in fear since he can hear Smaug approaching from behind him, but can’t see him.]

[Bard:] “Stay still, son. Stay still.”

[Smaug:] “Tell me, wretch - How now shall you challenge me?!”

[Bard notices a missing scale on Smaug’s chest, the scale that was broken by Girion, Lord of Dale. A small smile crosses Bard’s face.]

[Smaug:] “You have nothing left, but your DEATH!”

[Smaug howls, approaching more rapidly. Bain looks over his shoulder at the dragon, but Bard calls him back.]

[Bard:] “Bain! Look at me. You look at me.”

[Bard strains with the effort of holding the Black Arrow taut.]

[Bard:] “A little to your left.”

[Bain shifts a little to his left, moving the tip of the arrow to the right, toward the spot where Bard noticed the missing scale on Smaug.]

[Bard:] “That’s it.”

[Bard releases the Black Arrow and it flies off at high speed from Bain’s shoulder. It hurtles through the air and sinks all the way to the feathers, almost 6-7 feet, into Smaug’s chest through the spot without a scale. As Smaug leaps forward in pain and fear, Bard grabs Bain, just as Smaug careens into the tower. Bard and Bain fall with the tower into the water as Smaug rolls and slides through the town, destroying everything in the town. He struggles to fly into the sky. With massive effort, he manages to flap a few hundred feet up, screaming and wheezing in pain, then gasps for breath. His eyes lose their light, and he falls back down upon the city, dead, with the end of the arrow sticking out of his heart. He lands directly upon the Master’s boat, crushing it and presumably killing everyone on board.]



[The sound of Smaug hitting the ground echoes throughout the land, all the way to the dwarves on the mountain. They jump up in surprise.]

[Oin:] “What was that? What happened?”

[Bilbo:] “It fell. I saw it.”

[They all peer out at the town in the early morning light.]

[Bilbo:] “It’s dead. Smaug is dead!”

[Thorin, still staring at the Lonely Mountain and not at the town, has a strange expression of happiness cross his face.]

[Gloin:] “By my beard! I think he’s right! Look there! The ravens of Erebor are returning to the mountain!”

[Several birds can be seen cawing and approaching the Lonely Mountain.]

[Oin:] “Aye - Word will spread. Before long every soul in Middle-earth will know - The dragon is dead!”

[As the dwarves laugh in glee, Thorin hurries down from the lookout point and approaches the gates of Erebor.]

[On screen:] THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES



[In Dol Guldur, Gandalf languishes in his cage. Suddenly, Galadriel’s voice sounds in his head, and he looks up with a start.]

[Galadriel:] “You are not alone, Mithrandir…”

[Galadriel:] “... (Ae boe) i le eliathon, im tulithon.” [not translated onscreen: If you should ever need my help, I will come.]” 



[It is early morning. On the banks of the lake are refugees and wreckage from Laketown. People are screaming and crying, and some of the wooden things are on fire. There are dead bodies washed up on the shore. Alfrid comes crawling up out of the water, screaming.]

[Alfrid:] “Will somebody help me? HELP!”

[He clambers over a dead body, only to realize that the person is still alive. Alfrid rolls over him into the water, screaming.]

[Alfrid:] “HELP!”

[Meanwhile, some of the survivors begin helping each other and salvaging whatever supplies they can. Tauriel, Sigrid, and Tilda walk about, looking for Bard.]

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Alfrid screams up into the sky.]

[Alfrid:] “WHY ME?”

[There is still screaming and crying all about, as people pull the bodies of their loved ones out of the water and onto the shore. The dwarves, Oin, Bofur, and Fili, grab a boat and begin to push it out into the water. Kili approaches Tauriel.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel.”

[Fili:] “Kili, come on! We’re leaving.”

[Tauriel:] “They are your people - You must go.”

[Tauriel looks at Kili both sadly and guardedly, then walks past him. Kili looks distraught for a second, then whirls around to face her again.]

[Kili:] “Come with me. I know how I feel; I’m not afraid. You make me feel alive.”

[Tauriel turns her head away.]

[Tauriel:] “I can’t.”

[Kili reaches out and grabs her arm, then says something in Dwarvish.]

[Kili:] “Tauriel, amralime” (presumably, “Tauriel, my love”)

[Hearing this, Tauriel looks at Kili, shocked and surprised.]

[Tauriel:] “I don’t know what that means.”

[Kili smiles.]

[Kili:] “I think you do.”

[Tauriel smiles and begins to lean toward Kili, but then suddenly straightens up and makes her face blank. She addresses Legolas, whom she sensed approaching behind her.]

[Tauriel:] “Hîr nín, Legolas.” [Subtitle: My Lord Legolas.]

[Kili looks with hostility over Tauriel’s shoulder at Legolas.] 

[Legolas:] “Maewado i Naug.” [Subtitle: Take your leave of the Dwarf.]

[Legolas:] “Boe i nadh egeno.” [Subtitle: You are needed elsewhere.]

[Tauriel looks at Kili for a few more seconds, then, torn by her duty, begins to turn away. Kili sadly turns toward his friends launching the boat. He suddenly pauses, then turns around and hurries back to Tauriel. He takes her hand and places his black stone into it, folding her fingers closed over it. She gasps and looks at him as he gets close to her face and holds her hands to his heart.]

[Kili:] “Keep it. As a promise.”

[They smile at each other, then Kili runs toward the boat. Legolas looks on, confused. Tauriel looks down at the stone in her hand, then looks after Kili and the dwarves in the boat; her eyes are wet. Kili looks back at her for several moments, then begins rowing.]



[Meanwhile on shore, the woman from earlier who spoke about the prophecy hurries about, handing out blankets to the survivors.]

[Woman:] “These are dry. You need them.”

[Man:] “Thank you.”

[Alfrid pushes between people as he approaches the woman.]

[Alfrid:] “Oi! Give me one of them! I’ll catch my death in this cold!”

[Woman:] “Oh, find your own! You’re not in charge now, Alfrid Blackspell!”

[Alfrid:] “That is where you are wrong - In absence of the Master, the power cedes to his deputy, which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket!”

[He leans forward and grabs the blanket; she pulls back on the other end. They tug over it, yelling at each other.]

[Woman:] “Master’s deputy? Don’t make me laugh.”

[She manages to pull the blanket away and begins hitting Alfrid with it.]

[Woman:] “You’re a sneak-thief, more like. I’ll be dead, before I answer to the likes of you!”

[As she turns away, Alfrid grabs her.]

[Alfrid:] “Maybe that can be arranged!”

[Alfrid raises his hand to strike her, only to have someone else grab his upraised arm. It turns out to be Bard, who leans close to Alfrid.]

[Bard:] “I wouldn’t go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now!”

[Bard spins Alfrid around, and Alfrid trips and falls over Bain’s outstretched foot. Bain and the Woman smile. Sigrid and Tilda come running out of the crowd.]

[Tilda:] “DA!”

[Bard:] “Come here!”

[Bard grabs up his daughters in a huge hug. He clutches them to himself as the townspeople look on.]

[Bard:] “It’s alright.”

[A man, Percy (who used to check the papers of the boats entering town), steps out of the crowd and exclaims loudly.]

[Percy:] “It was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with my own eyes. He brought the beast down. He shot him dead, with a black arrow.”

[The people begin cheering for Bard and laying their hands on him, exclaiming their thanks.]

[Various Townspeople:] “You saved us all! Thank you.”

[Alfrid suddenly appears and raises Bard’s arm, then cheers loudly for him.]

[Alfrid:] “ALL HAIL - TO THE DRAGONSLAYER! ALL HAIL - KING BARD!”

[The people grow silent, and Bard yanks his hand away from Alfrid’s. Alfrid, still with his hand up in the air, speaks to the crowd.]

[Alfrid:] “I have said it many times - This is a man of noble stock. A born leader!”

[Bard:] “Do not call me that! I’m not the master of this town.”

[Bard looks around.]

[Bard:] “WHERE IS HE? WHERE’S THE MASTER?”

[Woman:] “Halfway down the Anduin, with all our coin, I don’t doubt. You would know!”

[She points at Alfrid, who looks scared.]

[Woman:] “You helped him empty the treasury.”

[Alfrid:] “No - I tried to stop him.”

[Alfrid raises his voice and addresses all the people, scared and pleadingly. The people yell at him angrily, calling him a traitor and a mongrel. Alfrid hides behind Bard, keeping Bard between himself and the Woman.]

[Alfrid:] “I pleaded. I pleaded. I said, ’Master - NO!’”

[As the people continue to yell abuse at him, Alfrid looks terrified.]

[Alfrid:] “Think of the children.”

[Alfrid grabs Tilda and holds her in front of him.]

[Alfrid:] “Will nobody think of the children?!”

[Tilda angrily stomps on Alfrid’s foot, forcing him to let go of her. The people yell for Alfrid’s head.]

[Man:] “To the tree with you!”

[Several men grab Alfrid and raise him up, preparing to hang him with a rope. He screams with fear. Bard steps in and stops the people.]

[Bard:] “Enough! Let him go! Let him go!”

[The people quiet down and let Alfrid fall to the ground. Bard turns about, addressing them all.]

[Bard:] “Look around you! Have you not had your fill of death?”

[Alfrid pops up.]

[Alfrid:] “Aye.”

[Bard pushes him back down.]

[Bard:] “Winter is upon us; we must look to our own, to the sick and the helpless. Those who can stand, tend to the wounded. And those who have strength left - follow me. We must salvage what we can.”

[Bard turns and begins to stride through the crowd.]

[Woman:] “What then? What do we do then?”

[Bard:] “We find shelter.”

[The townspeople begin to follow him as he walks away.]



[Fili, Kili, Bofur, and Oin climb up the Lonely Mountain. As they approach the gates, they stop in shock and fear as they see the destruction caused by Smaug as he smashed through the front gate to fly out of the mountain. They look at each other, then run into the halls of Erebor. Bofur calls out, his voice echoing in the silence.]

[Bofur:] “Hello! Bombur? Bifur? Anybody?”

[They clamber through the halls, looking for their kin. As they run down a staircase, Bilbo runs up toward them from another part of the city, calling out.]

[Bilbo:] “WAIT! WAIT!”

[Oin:] “It’s Bilbo! He’s alive!”

[Bilbo:] “Stop! Stop! Stop!”

[They meet each other in a corridor.]

[Bilbo:] “You need to leave. We all need to leave.”

[Bofur:] “We only just got here?!”

[Bilbo:] “I have tried talking to him, but he won’t listen.”

[Oin:] “What do you mean, laddie?”

[Bilbo:] “THORIN. Thorin. Thorin. He’s been out there for days. He doesn’t sleep. He barely eats. He’s not been himself - not at all. It’s this - It’s this place. I think a sickness lies on it.”

[As Bilbo speaks, Fili looks past him and sees something that causes him to wrinkle his face in consternation.]

[Kili:] “Sickness? What kind of sickness?”

[Fili walks past the group and starts heading further down into Erebor, looking at something. Bilbo and the others run after him, trying to stop him.

[Bilbo:] “Fili. Fili. Fili!”

[As they continue heading down, a golden light begins to be visible on the walls. They round a corner, and stop short at the sight of Smaug’s treasure, heaped so high over the floor of the cavern that the ground is barely visible. As they stare, they see Thorin, dressed in ornate robes and covered in jewelry, stride slowly out of a doorway. Thorin begins speaking softly, apparently to himself. He looks strange, almost possessed, and the dwarves look at him in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “Gold - Gold beyond measure. Beyond sorrow and grief.”

[Thorin looks up and sees the others standing there.]

[Thorin:] “Behold - the great treasure hoard of Thror.”

[He suddenly flings something high into the air to where the dwarves are standing on a stairwell landing, and Fili catches it. It is a giant bloodred jewel.]

[Thorin:] “Welcome, my sister’s sons, to the kingdom of EREBOR.”



[The newly-come dwarves enter the room where the other dwarves are, and they greet each other warmly with massive hugs.]

[Bofur:] “Balin!”

[Nori:] “Kili!”

[Bofur:] “Bombur!”



[All the dwarves comb through the piles of treasure, searching for the Arkenstone.]

[Thorin:] “Any sign of it?!”

[Dwalin:] “Nothing yet.”

[Nori:] “Nothing here.”

[Thorin:] “Keep searching!”

[Oin:] “That jewel could be anywhere!”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone is in these halls - find it!”

[Dwalin:] “You heard him - Keep looking!”

[Thorin:] “All of you - No one rests until it is found!” 

[Bilbo, hearing all this, looks awkward.]


[Bilbo walks out onto the ramparts of the front gates, near the hole Smaug made in the wall. He paces back and forth for a while. Then, after looking around to see that no one is watching, he sits down. He thinks back to his encounter with Smaug, when he is standing near the Arkenstone and Smaug is speaking to him.]

FLASHBACK - START

[Smaug:] “I am almost tempted to let you take it, if only to see Oakenshield suffer, watch it destroy him, watch it corrupt his heart and drive him mad.”

[Samgu growls and extends his neck to eat Bilbo, but Bilbo puts on his ring and slips away. Unseen by Smaug, Bilbo grabs the Arkenstone and hides it in his tunic. Smaug angrily begins breathing fire.]

FLASHBACK - END

[Once more checking than no one is watching, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out the Arkenstone. He stares at it, as it glows with patterns of light from within.]



[At the Laketown camp, the people are packing supplies and getting ready to leave.]

[Bard:] “Take only what you need. We have a long march ahead.”

[Legolas:] “Where will you go?”

[Bard looks across the lake.]

[Bard:] “Where is only one place.”

[Alfrid:] “The mountain! You are a genius, sire. We can take refuge inside the mountain. It might smell a bit of dragon - The women can clean up. It will be safe and warm and dry, and full of stores, bedding, clothing...the odd bit of gold.”

[Bard:] “What gold is in that mountain is cursed. We will take only what was promised to us - only what we need to rebuild our lives.”

[Bard dumps a bundle of sticks he was packing into Alfrid’s hands and walks off. Alfrid then dumps the sticks into the hands of an old woman who already has a load of sticks.]

[Alfrid:] “Here - pull your weight!“

[Legolas:] “News of the death of Smaug will have spread through the lands.”

[Bard:] “Aye.”

[Legolas:] “Other will now look to the mountain - for its wealth, or its position.”

[Bard:] “What is it you know?”

[Legolas:] “Nothing for certain. It’s what I fear may come.”

[Legolas, looking concerned, looks off into the distance.]



[Azog is riding his white warg at the head of a vast company of Orcs, all armed for battle. They are crossing a rocky plain, with the Lonely Mountain in the distance as their destination. Bolg, riding his Warg, charges in from Laketown to deliver his message to Azog.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Woodland Elves!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The King’s son and a She-elf - They tracked us down to Laketown.]

[Azog raises his arm, the hand of which Thorin cut off but is now replaced with a large blade, and the legions of Orcs stop.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: And you killed them?]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They fled squealing like cowards]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You fool! They will return with an Army of Elves at their backs!]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Ride to Gundabad.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Let the Legions come forth.]

[Bolg grunts in assent and rides off. Azog turns and faces his Orcs, raising his bladed arm.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Elves! Men! Dwarves! The Mountain will be their tomb!]

[He turns and begins riding toward the Mountain.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: To war!]



[Tauriel and Legolas stride through the Laketown camp.]

[Tauriel:] “You saw something out there.”

[Legolas:] “The orc I pursued out of Laketown - I know who he is. Bolg - a spawn of Azog the Defiler. A warg pack was waiting for him on the outskirts of Esgaroth. They fled into the north. These orcs were different from the others. They wore a mark I had not seen for a long time. The mark of Gundabad.”

[Tauriel stops in shock and turns to Legolas.]

[Tauriel:] “Gundabad?”

[Legolas:] “An orc-stronghold in the far north of the Misty Mountains.”

[An elf from Mirkwood rides up on a horse and addresses Legolas.]

[Elf:] “Hîr nín, Legolas. Celin ’winiath o adar lín.” [Subtitle: My Lord Legolas, I bring word from your Father.]

[Elf:] “Cân i hi danwenidh na le.” [Subtitle: You are to return to him immediately.] 

[Legolas:] “Tolo, Tauriel.” [Subtitle: Come, Tauriel.]

[Elf:] “Hîr nín. Edlennen Tauriel.” [Subtitle: My Lord, Tauriel is banished.]

[Legolas:] “Edlennen?” [Subtitle: Banished?]

[Both Legolas and Tauriel are surprised.]

[Legolas:] “You may tell my father: If there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me”

[Tauriel:] “Legolas. It is your King’s command”

[Legolas:] “Naw aran nín, mal ú-gân innas nín.” [Subtitle: Yes, he is my King. But he does not command my heart.]

[Legolas turns and walks away from the elven messenger.]

[Legolas:] “I ride north. Will you come with me?”

[Tauriel:] “To where?”

[Legolas:] “To Gundabad.”

[Tauriel and Legolas ride out of the Laketown camp on Legolas’s horse. The townspeople, carrying their possessions and stretchers with their sick and injured, begin the long trek around the lake and toward the Mountain.]



[In Dol Guldur, Gandalf begins chanting something while hanging in the cage. Meanwhile, Radagast is chanting in his home.]

[Gandalf:] “_ _ _”

[Radagast:] “_ _ _”

[Gandalf:] “_ _ _”

[An Orc approaches Gandalf, his sword bared.]
 
[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Spells will not save you, old man.]

[Meanwhile, Galadriel walks through the ruins of Dol Guldur, barefoot, her ring shining with a white light in the darkness.] 

[The orc throws Gandalf, still in his cage, around, while Gandalf cries out in pain.]

[Galadriel approaches Gandalf’s location, his cries of pain sounding loudly in the night as the Orc abuses him.]

[The Orc pulls open the cage and lifts Gandalf up with one arm.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: This is my Master’s domain.]

[He throws Gandalf forcefully down onto the floor.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Die now Wizard!]

[Galadriel appears, and the Orc sees her. The Orc roars, then runs at Galadriel. Galadriel lifts her arm, and a shockwave of power and energy expands all around her, lighting up the sky for miles around, as loose rubble flies around from the massive pressure.]

[With the Orc dead, Galadriel picks up Gandalf, who is almost dead, and walks through the ruins carrying him.]

[Sauron’s voice speaks out of the darkness, and Galadriel stops.]

[Sauron:] “Shre nazg golugranu kilmi-nudu” [Subtitle: Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky.]

[Sauron:] “Ombi kuzddurbagu gundum-ishi” [Subtitle: Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone.]

[Galadriel:] “Nine for mortal men doomed to die.”

[Galadriel looks around in shock as the nine Nazgul slowly become visible around her, in corporeal yet partially translucent forms. As they slowly draw closer, wielding their weapons, Galadriel stumbles back until she is sitting on the pedestal of a statue in a courtyard, with Gandalf in her lap. Still unconscious, Gandalf groans.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You cannot fight the shadow. Even now you fade. One light alone in the darkness.]

[Gandalf looks up with a determined face.]

[Galadriel:] “I am not alone.”

[Behind the Nazgul, Elrond and Saruman stride out of the ruins, Elrond wielding his sword and Saruman his staff.]

[Saruman:] “Are you in need of assistance, my Lady?”

[Snarling, the Nazgul leap forward to confront them.]

[Elrond:] “You should have stayed dead.”

[Elrond and Saruman leap forward, attacking the Nazgul. The Nazgul disappear every time they are hit, yet they keep coming back. Saruman throws a Nazgul off a cliff, but it manages to clamber back up the cliff and resumes attacking. Despite this, Saruman and Elrond are still fighting incredibly well.]

[Galadriel talks to Gandalf.]

[Galadriel:] “Mithrandir, come back.”

[As Saruman and Elrond fight in the background, Galadriel leans down and kisses Gandalf’s head. He suddenly breathes in deeply and wakes up, gasping for breath.]

[Gandalf:] “He is here.”

[Galadriel:] “Yes - the darkness has returned.”

[As the others continue fighting, Radagast appears in the courtyard on his rabbit-pulled sled.]

[Radagast:] “GANDALF! Gandalf, climb on!”

[As Gandalf tries to get on the sled, Galadriel lays on the floor, weakened from bringing Gandalf back from the brink of death. She tries to help him up, but she is too weak.]

[Galadriel:] “He is weak. He cannot remain here - It is draining his life.”

[Gandalf manages to get on the sled, and Radagast prepares to leave.]

[Galadriel:] “Go! Quickly!”

[Gandalf reaches back and grabs Galadriel’s arm. He speaks to her, his voice still hoarse and weak.]

[Gandalf:] “Come with me, my Lady.”

[Galadriel looks at him sadly, then pulls her arm away with an effort. Her skin becomes white and her eyes and body shine with a strange, powerful, and dark light. She turns to face the Nazgul.]

[Galadriel:] “NO!”

[As Radagast and Gandalf ride off, Galadriel lays on the floor, surrounded by fighting Nazgul and Elrond and Saruman. Eventually, Elrond and Saruman manage to kill all the Nazgul, and they pause for breath. As they approach Galadriel to see if she’s alright, the wind picks up, then a nearby tower explodes in a massive ball of fire. In its place is the flaming eye of Sauron. Saruman and Elrond flinch in the face of its power.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: It has begun.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The East will fall. So shall the Kingdom of Angmar rise.]

[The pupil of the Eye expands to reveal Saruon’s old form. Beside him rise the Nazgul, all of whom he has resurrected.]

[Sauron:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The time of the Elves is over. The Age of the Orc has come.]

[As the Nazgul raise their weapons and approach, Elrond and Saruman prepare to fight, only to step back as Galadriel rises. Galadriel is glowing with a green light, and her entire appearance has changed to one of power. She raises her hand, in which is a bright light coming from the Phial of Galadriel, and the Nazgul are blasted away, back into the Eye.]

[Galadriel:] “YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE, SERVANT OF MORGOTH!”

[The fire around the Eye disappears, leaving only Sauron’s armored form. Sauron is chanting as well. He begins flashing in the fire of his Eye.]

[Galadriel:] “YOU ARE NAMELESS, FACELESS, FORMLESS!”

[As she speaks, her voice changes into a deep, booming, and powerful tone. The Eye keeps flashing with fire and chanting in Black Speech, while Elrond and Saruman raise their hands to shield themselves from the battle of power between Galadriel and Sauron.]

[Galadriel:] “GO BACK TO THE VOID FROM WHENCE YOU CAME!”

[The force of her power extinguishes the Eye’s flames and sends Sauron hurtling into the sky. Galadriel’s powerful form disappears, and she staggers; Elrond catches her as she collapses. Sauron can be seen hurtling toward the horizon, presumably to land in Mordor. Gandalf and Radagast stop and look; Gandalf, holding his sword, is looking better.]

[Elrond:] “Dandollen hon.” [Subtitle: We were deceived.]

[Galadriel:] “The spirit of Sauron endured.”

[Saruman:] “And has been banished.”

[Galadriel:] “He will flee into the east.”

[Elrond:] “Gondor should be warned. The must set a watch on the walls of Mordor.”

[Saruman:] “No. Look after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her power. Her strength is failing. Take her to Lothlórien.”

[Elrond:] “My Lord Saruman, he must be hunted down and destroyed, once and for all.”

[Saruman:] “Without the Ring of Power, Sauron can never again hold dominion over Middle-earth. Go now! Leave Sauron to me.”

[Saurman turns to face the direction in which Sauron was hurled, with a strange expression in his eyes.]



[Gandalf and Radagast arrive at Rhosgobel.

[Gandalf:] “I need a horse!”

[Radagast:] “What? Gandalf, where are you going?”

[Gandalf:] “To warn Erebor. They have no idea what is coming. I saw them with my own eyes - rank upon rank of Moria-orcs. You must summon our friends, bird and beast - the battle for the mountain is about to begin.”



[In Erebor, Thorin gazes upon the throne, over which the Arkenstone had been inlaid before it was lost. He speaks to Balin, Dwalin, and Bilbo, who are behind him.]

[Thorin:] “It is here in these halls - I know it.”

[Dwalin:] “We have searched and searched…”

[Thorin:] “Not well enough!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, we all would see the stone returned.”

[Thorin:] “And yet, it is still not FOUND!”

[Balin:] “Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here?”

[Thorin turns and slowly walks toward Balin and Dwalin.]

[Balin:] “The Arkenstone is the birthright of our people.”

[Thorin:] “It is the King’s Jewel.”

[He begins shouting.]

[Thorin:] “AM I NOT THE KING?!”

[As Thorin turns away, Balin, Dwalin, and Bilbo look uneasy.]

[Thorin:] “Know this - If anyone should find it and withhold it from me, I will be avenged.”

[As Thorin walks away, Bilbo looks very disgruntled.]



[Balin is in a quiet corner somewhere, breathing deeply as if he had just been weeping. Bilbo finds him.]

[Balin:] “Dragon-sickness - I’ve seen it before. That look. That terrible need. It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad.”

[Bilbo:] “Balin, if-if Thorin...had the Arkenstone...”

[Bilbo slightly cocks his head, and Balin looks surprised, understanding Bilbo’s implication.]

[Bilbo:] “...if it was found - Would it help?”

[Balin:] “That stone crowns all. It is the summit of this great wealth, bestowing power upon he who bears it. Will it stay his madness? No, lad; I fear it would make it worse. Perhaps it is best that it remains lost.” 

[Balin raises his eyebrows at Bilbo.]



[Bilbo is sitting on a bench in a hall. He reaches into his coat pocket and pulls something out. Thorin, walking in an adjoining hallway, sees the action.]

[Thorin:] “What is that?!”

[Thorin strides rapidly toward Bilbo, and Bilbo rises.]

[Thorin:] “In your hand!”

[Bilbo:] “It-It’s nothing.”

[Thorin:] “Show me.”

[Bilbo:] “It…”

[Bilbo holds out his hand, and in it is an acorn.]

[Bilbo:] “I picked it up in Beorn’s garden.”

[Thorin:] “You’ve carried it all this way.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m gonna plant it in my garden, in Bag End.”

[His anger fading, Thorin smiles fondly at Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “That’s a poor price to take back to the Shire.”

[Bilbo:] “One day it’ill grow. And everytime I look at it, I’ll remember - Remember everything that happened, the good, the bad. And how lucky I am that I made it home.”

[They smile at each other. Bilbo prepares to speak.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin, I...”

[Suddenly, Dwalin comes up and interrupts.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, survivors...from Laketown. They are streaming into Dale. There’s hundreds of them.”

[Thorin’s smile fades into a stern, uncompromising face.]

[Thorin:] “Call everyone to the gate.”

[Thorin strides off, shouting.]

[Thorin:] “TO THE GATE! NOW!”



[The Laketowners walk into the ruins of Dale. They stare around at the ruins, including many charred and burned bodies.

[Bard:] “Come on, keep moving.”

[Alfrid:] “SIRE! Sire! Up here” 

[Bard looks up to see Alfrid on one of the city walls. Bard joins him.]

[Alfrid:] “Look sire, the braziers are lit.”

[They see giant braziers full of fire at the gates of Erebor.]

[Bard:] “So, the company of Thorin Oakenshield survived.”

[Alfrid:] “Survived? You mean there’s a bunch of dwarves in there with all that gold?”

[Bard:] “You shouldn’t worry, Alfrid. There’s gold enough in that mountain for all.”

[Bard walks away and calls to the people.]

[Bard:] “Make camp here tonight. Find what shelter you can. Get some fires going. Alfrid, you take the night watch.”

[As Alfrid looks sourly at Bard and stomps off, Bard looks back at the Mountain, uneasy.]



[Within the walls of Erebor, the dwarves work to block up the entrance that Smaug broke through. They carry rocks both by hand and with the help of various pulleys and other machines.] 

[Thorin:] “I want this fortress made safe by sunup. This mountain was hard won - I will not see it taken again.”

[Kili:] “The people of Laketown have nothing. They came to us in need. They have lost everything.”

[Thorin:] “Do not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough their hardship. Those who have lived through dragonfire should rejoice. They have much to be grateful for.”

[Thorin looks out at the city of Dale, where many fires can be seen lit by the people. He then turns and shouts to his dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “More stone! BRING MORE STONE TO THE GATE!”

[Bilbo looks on in despair.]



[Gandalf rides his horse rapidly through a plain.



[It is night in Dale, and the people sit around, as the healthy tend to the wounded. Infants can be heard crying.]

[Man:] “These children are starving! We need food!”

[Man:] “We won’t last three days!”

[Percy:] “Bard, we don’t have enough.” 

[Bard:] “Do want you can, Percy”

[Woman:] “We need more water.”

[Bard:] “The children, the wounded and the women come first.”

[Bard walks over to where Alfrid had been standing guard. Alfrid was actually napping, and he wakes up as Bard speaks.]

[Bard:] “Morning, Alfrid. What news from the night watch?”

[Alfrid:] “All quiet, sire, I must report. Nothing gets past me.”

[Yawning, he gets up and follow Bard outside, only to find that Bard has stopped suddenly in the archway.]

[Bard:] “Except an army of elves, it would seem.”

[Outside, the courtyard is packed full of Mirkwood elves dressed in full battle gear, standing in perfectly ordered lines. The people of Laketown begin coming out of their buildings and see the elves. Bard walks down the steps and approaches the elves, some lines of which turn and step back to make a pathway for Bard. As he exits out the bank of elves, King Thranduil rides up on his steed, and all the elves turn to face him.]

[Bard:] “My lord Thranduil; we did not look to see you here.”

[Thranduil:] “I heard you needed aid.”

[Thranduil turns and looks at a wagon that is pulling up; it is loaded with food and drink for the people. The people of Laketown smile and cheer, and begin unloading the cart with the elves’ help. Bard approaches Thranduil gratefully.]

[Bard:] “You have saved us! I do not how to thank you.”

[Thranduil:] “Your gratitude is misplaced. I did not come on your behalf.”

[Thranduil’s voice is cold.]

[Thranduil:] “I came to reclaim something of mine.”

[Meanwhile, in the Mountain, Thorin picks up a beautiful necklace made of tiny, shining, and white gems. We hear Thranduil speaking in a flashback from the previous movie.]

[DIALOG-FLASHBACK - START]

[Thranduil:] “There are gems in the mountain that I too desire. White gems of pure starlight.

[DIALOG-FLASHBACK - END]

[Thorin:] “The white gems of Lasgalen.”

[Thorin:] “I know an Elf-Lord who would pay a pretty price for these.”

[Thorin tosses the necklace back into the pile of jewels, scattering many of the tiny gems.]

[Meanwhile, back in Dale, Thranduil watches his troops march out of Dale. Bard runs up to him.]



[Bard:] “Wait! Please, wait! You would go to war over a handful of gems?”

[Thranduil:] “The heirlooms of my people are not lightly forsaken.”

[Bard:] “We are allies in this. My people also have a claim upon the riches in that mountain! Let me speak with Thorin!”

[Thranduil:] “You would try to reason with a dwarf?”

[Bard:] “To avoid war? Yes!”



[In Erebor, Thorin strides toward the blocked off gate, calling th other dwarves to him.]

[Thorin:] “Come on!”

[The dwarves lay down their tools, pick up their weapons, and follow him up the stairs they’ve created in the blockage, all the way to a platform they have built at the top of the gate from which they have a vantage point over the plain in front of the gate. They see the walls of Dale filled with Elves ready for war. Bard rides up the path to the gate on a horse, and stops in front of the gate.]

[Bard:] “Hail Thorin, son of Thrain! We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.”

[Thorin:] “Why do come to the gates of the king under the mountain armed for war?”

[Bard:] “Why does the king under the mountain fence himself in? Like a robber in his hole.”

[Thorin:] “Perhaps it is because I am expecting to be robbed.”

[Bard:] “My lord - We have not come to rob you, but to seek fair settlement. Will you not speak with me?”

[Thorin nods, and steps away from the platform and down the stairs. Bard dismounts his horse and crosses the bridge in front of the gate. As he approaches the blockade, a raven flies out of the opening above the gate and wings away rapidly, cawing loudly. Bard sees a hole built into the blockade, and Thorin strides up to the other end of the hole.]

[Thorin:] “I’m listening.”

[Bard:] “On behalf of the people of Laketown, I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure so that they might rebuild their lives.”

[Thorin:] “I will not treat with any man while an armed host lies before my door.”

[Bard:] “That armed host will attack this mountain, if we do not come to terms.”

[Thorin:] “Your threats do not sway me.”

[Bard:] “What of your conscience? Does it not tell you our cause is just?! My people offered you help. And in return you brought upon them only ruin and death!”

[Thorin:] “When did the men of Laketown come to our aid, but for the promise of rich reward?!”

[Bard:] “A bargain was struck!”

[Thorin:] “A bargain? What choice did we have but to barter our birthright for blankets and food? To ransom our future in exchange for our freedom? You call that a fair trade? Tell me, Bard the Dragonslayer…”

[Bard looks up, surprised.]

[Thorin:] “...Why should I honor such terms?”

[Bard:] “Because you gave us your word. Does that mean nothing?”

[Thorin turns away from the hole, disappearing from Bard’s view. He leans back against the blockade and for a moment looks tired and weary. He then looks at the other dwarves and Bilbo, who are all standing there. He shouts back to Bard.]

[Thorin:] “Be gone, ere arrow fly!”

[Bard slaps the rock angrily, then mounts his horse and rides back to Dale. The company watches him go from the top of the platform.]

[Bilbo:] “What are you doing?! You cannot go to war.”

[Thorin:] “This does not concern you.”

[Bilbo:] “Excuse me?! But just in case you haven’t noticed, there is an army of elves out there. And not to mention several hundred angry fishermen. We-We are in fact outnumbered.”

[Thorin turns to look at Bilbo, smiling.]

[Thorin:] “Not for much longer.”

[Bilbo:] “What does that mean?”

[Thorin:] “It means Master Baggins, you should never underestimate dwarves.”

[Thorin turns to the whole group.]

[Thorin:] “We have reclaimed Erebor - Now we defend it!”

[As Thorin strides down the steps, Bilbo and Balin looks distressed.]



[Bard rides back to the gates of Dale, where Thranduil is waiting.]

[Bard:] “He will give us nothing.”

[Thranduil:] “Such a pity. Still, you tried.”

[Bard:] “I do not understand - Why? Why would he risk war?”

[They look back toward the Mountain in time to see the dwarves dislodge the head of one of the massive stone statues, causing it to fall and break the raised bridge to the gate, thus disabling any attackers from approaching the gates.]

[Thranduil:] “It is fruitless to reason with them; they understand only one thing.”

[Thranduil pulls out his sword and gazes at it.]

[Thranduil:] “We attack at dawn! Are you with us?”

[As Thranduil rides back toward the city, Bard looks over his shoulder at Erebor.]



[In Dale, Bard and the Lakepeople begin collecting and distributing the various weapons and armor stored there. In Erebor, the dwarves do the same, suiting up for battle. As Bilbo walks by, Thorin calls out to him, holding something.]

[Thorin:] “Master Baggins, come here!”

[Bilbo comes up and sees that Thorin is holding a tunic of white mail.]

[Thorin:] “You are going to need this. Put it on.”

[Bilbo begins removing his jacket.]

[Thorin:] “This vest is made of silver steel - “Mithril” it was called by my forebears.”

[Thorin holds it up so that Bilbo can slide into it.]

[Thorin:] “No blade can pierce it.”

[Bilbo finishes putting it on, then looks at himself; the other dwarves watch too.]

[Bilbo:] “I look absurd. I’m not a warrior; I’m a Hobbit.”

[Thorin:] “It is a gift. A token of our friendship. True friends are hard to come by.”

[Although he had started off smiling at Bilbo, he looks toward the other dwarves and frowns, then grabs Bilbo by the shoulder and pulls him away where the other dwarves can’t hear him.]

[Thorin:] “I have been blind. Now I begin to see. I am betrayed!”

[Bilbo:] “Betrayed?”

[Thorin:] “The Arkenstone.”

[As Thorin moves closer to him, Bilbo looks extremely uncomfortable and worried. Thorin whispers to Bilbo.]

[Thorin:] “One of them has taken it.”

[Bilbo almost sighs audibly in relief.]

[Thorin:] “One of them is false.”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin...the quest is fulfilled. You’ve won the mountain. Is that not enough?”

[Thorin:] “Betrayed by my own kin.”

[Bilbo:] “No eh...You...You made a promise...to the people of Laketown. Is-Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor? Our honor, Thorin. I was also there, I gave my word.”

[Thorin:] “For that I’m grateful. It was nobly done. But the treasure in this mountain does not belong to the people of Laketown! This gold...is ours...and ours alone. By my life I will not part with a single coin! Not...one...piece of it!”

[As Thorin speaks, his voice grows deeper and more and more like Smaug’s, until the very last line, which was exactly a repeat of what Smaug had said previously to Bilbo. Thorin is clearly mentally affected, and Bilbo stares at him in shock as the other dwarves, dressed for battle, stride by.]



[Legolas and Tauriel leave their horses and scramble up a rocky outcrop. They crouch behind some rocks at the top and see a fortress ahead.]

[Tauriel:] “Gundabad. What lies beyond?”

[Legolas:] “An old enemy - The ancient kingdom of Angmar. This fortress was once its stronghold. It is where they kept their great armories, forged their weapons of war.”

[A light flickers in a window of the fortress, then disappears.]

[Tauriel:] “A light! I saw movement.”

[Legolas:] “We wait for the cover of night. It is a fell place, Tauriel. In another age our people waged war on those lands.”

[Legolas pauses, looking pained. Tauriel looks at him.]

[Legolas:] “My mother died there. My father does not speak of it. There is no grave, no memory, nothing.”



[In Dale, the people are preparing for war, sharpening swords and collecting supplies. They jump out of the way as Gandalf gallops into town on his horse.]

[Gandalf:] “Let me through!”

[Gandalf:] “Make way!”

[Gandalf dismounts in the main courtyard and looks surprised to see men drilling with swords and companies of elves marching by. Alfrid comes up to him, upset.]

[Alfrid:] “No, No, NO! Oi! You - pointy hat!”

[Gandalf turns to look at him.]

[Alfrid:] “Yes, you. We don’t want no tramps, beggars nor vagabonds around here. We got enough trouble without the likes of you. Off you go! On your horse.”

[Gandalf:] “Who’s in charge here?!”

[Bard walks up.]

[Bard:] “Who is asking?”



[A little bit later, Gandalf is meeting with Bard and Thranduil in a tent.]

[Gandalf:] “You must set aside your petty grievances with the dwarves. War is coming! The cesspits of Dol Guldur have been emptied. You’re ALL in mortal danger!”

[Bard:] “What are you talking about?”

[Thranduil:] “I can see you know nothing of wizards. They are like winter thunder on a wild wind rolling in from a distance, breaking hard in alarm. But sometimes a storm is just a storm.”

[Gandalf:] “Not this time. Armies of orcs are on the move. And these are fighters! They have been bred for war. Our enemy has summoned his full strength.”

[Thranduil:] “Why show his hand now?”

[Gandalf:] “Because we forced him! We forced him when the company of Thorin Oakenshield set out to reclaim their homeland. The dwarves were never meant to reach Erebor; Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the mountain. Not just for the treasure within, but for where it lies, its strategic position.”

[As Gandalf talks, they have left the tent and walked outside to a spot from where they can clearly see the gates of Erebor.]

[Gandalf:] “This is the gateway to reclaiming the lands of Angmar in the north. If that fell kingdom should rise again, Rivendell, Lothlorien, the Shire, even Gondor itself will fall!”

[Thranduil:] “These orc armies you speak of, Mithrandir - Where are they?”

[Gandalf is unable to answer.]



[Meanwhile, an Orc rides out of a tunnel on a Warg and approaches Azog, who is feeding his Warg at the entrance to the tunnel.]

[Orc:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Our army will be in position by dawn. The attack will be sudden and swift!]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: The fools! They have forgotten what lives beneath these lands.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They have forgotten the great Earth-eaters.]

[As they ride away, we see the side of a hill covered in giant holes, each the entrance to a tunnel. A sound of the earth being drilled and crushed can be heard all around. The tunnels are pointing toward the Lonely Mountain in the distance.]



[Back at Gundobad, it is dark.]

[Tauriel:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: If we are going in - we should move now.]

[Suddenly, massive bats being screeching and flying around.]

[Tauriel:] “Dúilith secherig.” [Subtitle: They are swarming.]

[Legolas:] “These bats are bred for one purpose.”

[Tauriel:] “For what?”

[Legolas:] “For war.”

[As the bats swarm overhead, a figure rides out on a Warg. It is Bolg, dressed for battle. He raises his mace and shouts out a command; trumpets sound, and gates in the bottom of the fortress open, releasing rank upong rank of massive orcs, each with a giant spear at least three times longer than the orcs’ height.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”

[The massive company begins marching away, with the bats following and wheeling overhead.]

[Tauriel:] “Din methithar i phain.” [Subtitle: We must warn the others.]

[Legolas:] “Penim lû. Tolo!” [Subtitle: We may be too late - hurry!]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _”

[As Bolg yells out a command, the ranks of Orcs part to let smaller, lighter, and faster Orcs run ahead of their companions, snarling.]



[Back in Thranduil’s tent, Gandalf confronts Thranduil.]

[Gandalf:] “Since when has my council counted for so little? What do you think I’m trying to do?!”

[Thranduil:] “I think you’re trying to save your dwarvish friends. And I admire your loyalty to them, but it does not dissuade me from my course. You started this, Mithrandir. You will forgive me if I finish it.”

[Thranduil exits the tent and calls to one of the elves.]

[Thranduil:] “Are the archers in position?”

[Elf:] “Yes my Lord.”

[Thranduil:] “Give the order. If anything moves on that mountain - kill it!”

[Thranduil:] “The dwarves are out of time.”



[It is night; at the blocked off entrance to the gate, a rope is suddenly thrown over the edge. Bilbo clambers hand-over-hand down the rope, slipping along the way. He manages to climb across the moat using some of the rubble. He begins running toward Dale.]



[Gandalf approaches Bard.]

[Gandalf:] “You, Bowman! Do you agree with this? Is gold so important to you? Would you buy it with the blood of dwarves?!”

[As the speak, Bilbo sneaks past some of the Laketown guards.]

[Bard:] “It will not come to that. This is a fight they cannot win.”

[Suddenly, Bilbo appears and addresses both of them.]

[Bilbo:] “That won’t stop them. You think the dwarves will surrender - They won’t. They will fight to the death to defend their own.”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins!”

[Bilbo smiles happily.]



[Back in Thranduil’s tent, Bilbo is presented before Thranduil.]

[Thranduil:] “If I’m not mistaken, this is the halfling who stole the keys to my dungeons from under the nose of my guards.”

[Bilbo looks extremely uncomfortable.]

[Bilbo:] “Yes. Sorry about that.”

[There is a silence for a while, then Bilbo steps forward and puts a wrapped package on the table.]

[Bilbo:] “I came...to give you this.”

[He unwraps the package to reveal the Arkenstone. Thranduil rises in surprise.]

[Thranduil:] “The heart of the mountain! The King’s Jewel.”

[Gandalf and Bard approach to look at it in awe.]

[Bard:] “And worth a king’s ransom. How is this yours to give?”

[Bilbo:] “I took it as my fourteenth share of the treasure.”

[Gandalf smiles slightly.]

[Bard:] “Why would you do this? You owe us no loyalty.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not doing it for you. I know that dwarves can be obstinate and pigheaded and difficult, suspicious and secretive…with the worst manners you can possibly imagine, but they also brave and kind...and loyal to a fault. I’ve grown very fond of them, and I would save them if I can.”

[Bilbo:] “Thorin values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, I believe he will give you what you are owed. There will be no need for war!”

[Gandalf, Bard, and Thranduil look at each other.]



[Gandalf leads through Dale.]

[Gandalf:] “Rest up tonight. You must leave on tomorrow.”

[Bilbo:] “What?”

[Gandalf:] “Get as far away from here as possible.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m-I’m not leaving. You picked me as the fourteenth man. I’m not about to leave the company now.”

[Gandalf:] “There is no company - not any more. And I don’t like to think what Thorin will do when he finds out what you’ve done.”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not afraid of Thorin.”

[Gandalf:] “But you should be! Don’t underestimate the evil of gold. Gold over which a serpent has long brooded. Dragon-sickness seeps into the hearts of all who come near this mountain.”

[Gandalf looks at Bilbo appraisingly.]

[Gandalf:] “Almost all.”

[Gandalf sees Alfrid walking by and calls out to him.]

[Gandalf:] “You there! Find this Hobbit a bed, and fill his belly with hot food. He has earned it.”

[Alfrid grudgingly comes over and begins to lead Bilbo away. As they go, Gandalf grabs Alfrid’s arm and whispers to him.]

[Gandalf:] “Hey. Keep an eye on him. If he should try to leave, you will tell me.”

[Alfrid walks off, cursing as a group of people walk in front of him and he pushes his way between them.]

[Alfrid:] “Move it! Stupid...”



[Early the next morning, we see that the plain in front of the Mountain is covered in legions of Elves and men, armed for battle. The dwarves, also prepared, watch from above the gate blockade.]



[Alfrid comes to wake Bilbo up, carrying a bowl of food.]

[Alfrid:] “Wakey, Wakey, Hobbit. Up you...get.”

[He pauses as he realizes that Bilbo is not in the room where he had left him.]



[Thranduil and Bard ride together to the front of the armies and approach their side of the broken bridge over the moat. From above the blockade, Thorin draws a bow and shoots an arrow at the ground directly in front of Thranduil and Bard, who immediately halt in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “I will put the next one between your eyes!”

[Thorin draws his bow again, and the dwarves on the wall cheer and shake their weapons. Thranduil stares at Thorin angrily, then slightly tilts his head. Instantly, several rows of Elves near the front of the army pull out their bows, nock their arrows, and aim at the dwarves, all in one fluid motion. The dwarves’ cheering cuts off abruptly as all of them but Thorin duck behind the ramparts. After holding the pose for a few seconds, Thranduil raises his hand, and the elves easily put away their arrows. Thorin still has his bow drawn, though.]

[Thranduil:] “We’ve come to tell you: payment of your debt has been offered...and accepted.” 

[Thorin:] “What payment? I gave you nothing! You have nothing!”

[Bard:] “We have this.”

[Bard reaches into his robe and pulls out the Arkenstone, holding it above his head. Thorin, shocked, lowers his bow.]

[Kili:] “They have the Arkenstone? Thieves! How came you by the heirloom of our house? That stone belongs to the king!”

[Bard:] “And the king may have it - in our good will.”

[Bard puts the Arkenstone back into his robe.]

[Bard:] “But first he must honor his word.”

[Thorin whispers to himself, and the dwarves near him can hear.]

[Thorin:] “They are taking us for fools. This is a ruse, a filthy lie.”

[Balin looks shocked that Thorin’s mental state has deteriorated to the point at which he would even consider this. Thorin then yells out.]

[Thorin:] “THE ARKENSTONE IS IN THIS MOUNTAIN! IT IS A TRICK!”

[At the top of the ramparts, Bilbo steps out from the dwarves.]

[Bilbo:] “It-It’s no trick. The stone is real. I gave it to them.”

[As Bilbo speaks, Thorin’s expression changes to a mixture of sorrow and anger. Thranduil and Bard look worries, as they thought Bilbo was still safely in Dale. Thorin and the other dwarves look at Bilbo in shock.]

[Thorin:] “You…”

[Bilbo:] “I took it as my fourteenth share.”

[Thorin:] “You would steall from me?”

[Bilbo:] “Steal from you? No. No. I may be a burglar, but I like to think I’m an honest one. I’m willing to let it stand against my claim.”

[Thorin:] “Against your claim?! Your claim! You have no claim over me you miserable rat!”

[Thorin throws down his bow in anger and begins walking toward Bilbo.]

[Bilbo:] “I was going to give it to you. Many times I wanted to, but...”

[Thorin:] “But what, thief?!”

[Bilbo:] “You are changed, Thorin! The dwarf I met in Bag End would never have gone back on his word! Would never have doubted the loyalty of his kin!”

[Thorin:] “Do not speak to me...of loyalty!”

[Thorin shouts to the other dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “Throw him from the rampart!”

[Bilbo looks shocked. The other dwarves, rather than obeying Thorin, step away from Bilbo in confusion. Thranduil and Bard look concerned. Thorin is surprised that no one obeyed him.]

[Thorin:] “DO YOU HEAR ME?!”

[Thorin grabs Fili’s arm, but Fili shakes him away.]

[Thorin:] “I will do it myself!”

[He lunges forward and grabs Bilbo, shouting.]

[Thorin:] “CURSE YOU!”

[Fili:] “No!”

[As Thorin struggles with Bilbo, the other dwarves leap forward, shouting, to pull Thorin away. Thorin manages to grab Bilbo and begins pushing him over the rampart.]

[Thorin:] “Cursed be the Wizard that forced you on this Company!”

[Suddenly, Gandalf appears, striding through the armies. His voice is magically amplified to incredibly loud, deep, and powerful tones.]

[Gandalf:] “IF YOU DON’T LIKE MY BURGLAR…”

[His voice returns to a normal volume and tone.]

[Gandalf:] “Then please don’t damage him. Return him to me! You’re not making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain, are you? Thorin son of Thrain!”

[Thorin slowly lets Bilbo up, and some of the other dwarves rush to help Bilbo up.]

[Thorin:] “Never again will I have dealings with wizards...”

[Bofur gently pushes Bilbo toward the rope he’d hung the night before to climb down the walls.]

[Bofur:] “Go.”

[Thorin:] “Or Shire-rats!”

[Bilbo throws his coiled rope over the wall and clambers down.]

[Bard:] “Are we resolved? The return of the Arkenstone for what was promised.”

[Thorin, breathing heavily, looks to a ridge in the distance, as if looking for someone or something.]

[Bard:] “Give us your answer! Will you have peace or war?”

[As Thorin bows his head, a large raven flies up to the ramparts and perches beside him. Thorin and the raven stare at each other.]

[Thorin:] “I will have war!”

[A rumbling is heard in the distance, and the armies look up to see the ridge being covered by troops of heavily armored dwarves, lead by a huge dwarf riding a battle-pig.]

[Gandalf:] “Ironfoot.”

[The Erebor dwarves begin cheering and screaming as they see their backup arriving.]

[Thranduil:] “Ribo i thangail!” [not translated onscreen: Rush the shield-fence!]

[Thranduil rides through his army as his Elves and the Lakepeople turn away from the gates of Erebor and begin marching quickly toward the oncoming Iron Hills dwarves. Gandalf strides along with them, Bilbo rushing to keep up.]

[Bilbo:] “Who is that? He doesn’t look very happy.”

[Gandalf:] “It is Dain, lord of the Iron Hills - Thorin’s cousin.”

[Bilbo:] “Are they alike?”

[Gandalf:] “I always found Thorin the more reasonable of the two.”

[The two armies halt a short distance from one another, and Dain rides his pig onto a rocky overlook to address the Elves and Men.]

[Dain:] “Good morning! How are we all? I have a wee proposition, if you wouldn’t mind giving me a few moments of your time. Would you consider...just sodding off!”

[The townspeople, clutching their weapons, step back in fear, while the Elves pull out their swords and step forward.]

[Dain:] “All of you - right now!”

[Bard:] “Stand fest!”

[Gandalf strides forward.]

[Gandalf:] “Come now, lord Dain!”

[Dain:] “Gandalf the Grey. Tell this rabble to leave, or I’ll water the ground with their blood!”

[Gandalf:] “There is no need for war between dwarves, men and elves! A legion of orcs march on the mountain. Stand your army down!”

[Dain:] “I will not stand down before any elf! Not least this faithless woodland sprite!”

[He gestures toward Thranduil, who looks angry.]

[Dain:] “He wishes nothing but ill upon my people! If he chooses to stand between me and my kin - I’ll split his pretty head open! See if he’s still smirking then!”

[Thranduil smiles furiously, and the Erebor dwarves cheer.]

[Thranduil:] “He’s clearly mad, like his cousin!”

[Dain:] “You hear that, lads?!”

[He turns and rejoins his army.]

[Dain:] “Come on! Let’s give these ***** a good hammering!”

[Iron Hills Dwarf:] “_ _ _”

[A dwarf yells out a command, and the Iron Hills dwarves raise their weapons and cheer. The Elves perform a complicated maneuver to put their shield-and-spear bearers at the front of the army, while the arches stand behind them. As both armies prepare to fight, a rumbling is heard at the base of a spur of the mountain. The armies grow silent as they turn to look. Gandalf whispers to himself.]

[Gandalf:] “Were-worms!”

[At the spur of the mountain where the rumbling is coming from, massive worms, hundreds of feet long and dozens of feet thick, break through the rocks. Their mouths are essentially giant drilling machines, strong enough to crush the toughest rocks in their jaws. The human, Elf, and dwarf armies look on in shock.]

[Dain:] “Oh, come on!”

[The worms suddenly retreat into the tunnels they’d made through the mountains approaching the Lonely Mountain. As the mist clears, we see Azog and a few other Orcs standing atop a hill. Behind them are several massive contraptions made of wood, rope, and cloth, meant as signalling devices. 

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Come forth my Armies!]

[As Azog gives a sign, one of the wooden structures opens up in a particular position, and a horn sounds. Immediately, legions of Orcs begin pouring out of the were-worm tunnels.]

[Dain:] “The hordes of hell are upon us! To battle! To battle, sons of Durin!”

[Dain and part of his army turn and rush toward the oncoming Orcs.]

[Fili:] “I’m going over the wall! Who’s coming with me?”

[The other dwarves cheer and agree, preparing to climb down.]

[Thorin:] “Stand down!”

[Dwarf:] “What?”

[Fili:] “Are we to do nothing?”

[Thorin:] “I said STAND DOWN!”

[As Thorin walks away, the other look on in shock and surprise. Meanwhile, as Dain and a company of his dwarves rush toward the oncoming Orcs, the Elves stay right where they are. The dwarves are clearly outnumbered by the Orcs.]

[Bilbo:] “The elves, will they not fight?”

[Gandalf:] “Thranduil! This is madness!”

[Thranduil looks back at the Iron Hills dwarves, who have stopped and built a shield wall with their massive spears pointed outward, lead by the chants of the leader. The orcs are fast approaching the shield wall. Suddenly, right as the Orcs reach the dwarves, the Elves leap up over the shield wall from behind, wielding their swords, and begin raining down blows on the Orcs. As the Elves press forward, the dwarvish shield wall is raised and the dwarves rush forward, cutting down Orcs with their spears. Dain rides furiously through the Orcs, smashing them left and right with his hammer.]

[As the remaining elves march toward the battle, Gandalf and Bilbo are standing in one place.]

[Bilbo:] “Eh, Gandalf - Is this a good place to stand?”

[At the top of the hill, Azog commands his Orcs.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Send in the War Beasts!]

[The wooden signalling devices change their position to show a new signal. Gandalf, seeing the signal, looks toward the tunnels to see new legions of Orcs, including massive trolls and other monsters, come out. Thranduil shouts to his troops.]

[Thranduil:] “_ _ _” 

[The Elves stop and pull out their bows.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They cannot fight on two fronts. Now we make our move.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Attack the city!]

[As a horn sound and the signalling device changes again, another legion of Orcs that had been waiting for the signal turn and march toward Dale, which is between the current battle and the tunnels.]

[Gandalf:] “Azog - he’s trying to cut us off”

[They see massive trolls, each large enough to carry multiple other dwarves and wooden structures such as catapults on their back, march toward the city along with the armies of Orcs.]

[Bard:] “All of you, fall back to Dale! Now!”

[Bard, the Lakepeople, Gandalf, and Bilbo rush toward the city, trying to intercept the Orcs.]

[Gandalf:] “To the city! Bilbo! This way!”

[The monstrous trolls approaching the city stop at a rise overlooking Dale. They bend over and plant all four legs on the ground, thus making their backs horizontal. On their backs are catapults loaded with large rocks; orcs on the trolls’ backs wind up the gears of the catapults. At a signal from their leader orc, who strikes the ground with his mace, the catapults are released, and the rocks fly toward Dale. They smash into the walls and towers, destroying everything they hit. As Bard, at the front of his army, rides across a bridge into Dale, we see the Orc army approaching the wall from another area. A troll with a giant triangle-shaped rock strapped to his head runs up to the wall and smashes into it headfirst, knocking it down and knocking himself out in the some motion. The orcs behind him rush into the city through the hole, entering the houses and killing whatever people they find.] 



[In the city, the screaming townspeople flee from the oncoming orcs. Sigrid and Tilda hide in a building as they see a troll climb over the wall. Meanwhile, Bain, holding a sword, looks for them among the fleeing people.]

[Bain:] “Sigrid! Tilda!”



[Bard rides into the city and dismounts, drawing his sword. He runs against the flow of the fleeing people, looking for his children.]

[Bard:] “My children! Where are my children?”

[Woman:] “I saw them. They were down in the old market.”

[Bard:] “The market?! Where are they now? Tilda! Sigrid!”

[Percy runs up at the head of a company of the Laketown soldiers.]

[Percy:] “Bard, Orcs are storming over the causeway!”

[Bard:] “Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them off for as long as you can!”

[Percy:] “Archers, this way!”

[Fleeing Man:] “The orcs have taken Stone Street! The market’s overrun!”

[Bard:] “The rest of you, follow me!”

[Bard’s group encounters the orcs, and they begin fighting. Elsewhere in Dale, Gandalf and Bilbo are also fighting the orcs. A group of townspeople run toward the orcs, and Alfrid is running with them.]

[Alfrid:] “Charge! Onward! To the death!”

[While still shouting, he stops running, panting for breath. Seeing that no one is watching him, he hides in a building.]

[Orcs are chasing Sigrid and Tilda. As they run screaming around a corner, Bain jumps out and kills the lead orc. The second orcs knocks him to the ground and swings at him, only to get his sword caught on something overhead. Bain uses this chance to thrust his sword into the orc, killing it. He and his sisters round a corner and see their father fighting further up the lane, uphill from them.]

[Sigrid:] “DA!”

[Tilda:] “Da! We’re down here!”

[Bain:] “Here!”

[Bard hears them and turns to see them, looking relieved. However, his expressions changes to shock when he sees a troll enter the lane behind the children, throwing men many feet away with a single blow of his mace. The troll sees the children and growls, and the girls scream. They are too far away for Bard to reach them in time, and he looks around frantically. As the troll approaches the children, Bard tilts upright a cart that had been laying sideways in the courtyard. He scrambles into it and launches it down the avenue toward the children. The troll raises its mace to smash the children, but pauses in surprise when it sees Bard hurtling toward it in the cart.]

[Bard:] “BAIN, SIGRID - GET DOWN!”

[They throw themselves to the floor as the cart bounces over them. It then smashes into the troll and sends it flying; Bard is also thrown forward, and he manages to thrust his sword into the troll’s heart in a flying strike.]



[We see an overhead shot of both battlefields: the plains in front of Erebor, and the battle in Dale. Bard and his children run up an empty street.]

[Bard:] “Listen - I need you to gather the women and children. Take them to the Great Hall and barricade the door.”

[Alfrid, hiding in a doorway nearby, hears them speaking. Bard gently takes Bain’s sword from him.]

[Bard:] “You understand - you must not come out for any reason!”

[Tilda:] “We wanna stay with you!”

[Alfrid steps out.]

[Alfrid:] “Show your father some respect!”

[Alfrid:] “You leave it to me, sire. You heard him, we make to the Great Hall!”

[Alfrid grabs Tilda and Sigrid and begins rushing them away. Bard calls after him.]

[Bard:] “Alfrid, women and children only. I need every man fighting. See that you return!”

[He thrusts the sword into Alfrid’s hands.]

[Alfrid:] “I’ll get them to safety, sire.”

[Seeing orcs appear nearby, he nervously hurries away.]

[Alfrid:] “And my sword is yours to command.”

[He begins rounding up the people he sees.]

[Alfrid:] “Get up!”

[Bard holds Bain’s face earnestly.]

[Bard:] “Look after them!”

[Alfrid:] “Shift it, granny!”

[As Bain catches up to Alfrid, Alfrid rudely tosses him the sword, and Bain looks at him in disgust.]

[Bard and his men continue fighting orcs.]

[Bain and the other help the weak and elderly.]

[Bain:] “Make for the Great Hall!”

[As they approach the Great Hall, Alfrid runs and pushes his way through the people, knocking many of them over in his haste to reach the doors.]

[Alfrid:] “Out of my way! Abandon the cripples!”



[As more and more orcs and trolls enter the city, Thranduil rides his elk into the city by crossing one of the bridges. As he crosses, his elk tramples many orcs. The elk lowers its horns and spears five orcs at the same time, lifting them up so that Thranduil can behead all of them with one swing of his sword. As they thunder into the city, the elk is killed by multiple Orc arrows to the chest. As it falls, Thranduil leaps clear and rolls. He comes up from his roll to find himself surrounded by orcs. He pulls out both his sword and begins fighting them, soon reinforced by his elven foot troops.]

[In the city, the men, elves, and orc all fight each other, and the orcs seems to have the upper hand because of their massive numbers. Azog watches from his hilltop vantage point.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: They cannot hold the city. The Dwarves are almost spent.]

[In the plains in front of Erebor, the Iron Hills dwarves are being driven back by the orcs. Orcs manage to kill Dain’s war pig.]

[Dain:] “You buggars!”

[He begins killing orcs left and right with his hammer and by headbutting them.]

[Dain:] “Where’s Thorin?! We need him! Where is he?”

[From his vantage point, Azog gloats as both battlefronts are being won by the orcs.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Let these lands run with blood! Slaughter them all.]

[Bard:] “FALL BACK!”



[Meanwhile, in Erebor, Thorin is merely sitting on the throne. Dwalin approaches him.]

[Dwalin:] “Since when do we forsake our own people? Thorin, they are dying out there.”

[Thorin:] “There are halls beneath halls within this mountain - places we can fortify.”

[Dwalin looks disappointed and angry.]

[Thorin:] “Shore up, make safe. Yes…”

[Thorin:] “...Yes - that is it. We must move the gold further underground - to safety!”

[Thorin begins walking away, but Dwalin angrily calls out to him.]

[Dwalin:] “Did you not hear me?! Dain is surrounded! They’re being slaughtered, Thorin.”

[Thorin:] “Many die in war. Life is cheap. But a treasure such as this cannot be counted in lives lost. It is worth all the blood we can spend!”

[Dwalin:] “You sit here in these vast halls, with a crown upon your head, and yet you are lesser now than you have ever been.”

[Thorin:] “Do not speak to me as if I was some lowly dwarf lord…”

[As he speaks, Thorin is clearly mentally affected.]

[Thorin:] “As-As if I were still...Thorin...Oakenshield.”

[Thorin:] “I AM YOUR KING!”

[Thorin roars and pulls out his sword; however, he is so unbalanced that he almost falls over.]

[Dwalin:] “You were always my king. You used to know that once.”

[Dwalin bows his head in sorrow.]

[Dwalin:] “You cannot see that you have become.”

[Thorin:] “Go! Get out...before I kill you.”

[After looking at each other for a while, Dwalin turns and leaves.]



[Thorin walks through the hall in which he tried to drown Smaug; the entire floor is covered in gold a few feet deep. In his head, he hears many of the words that he spoke or were spoken to him earlier.]

[Bilbo:] “...is this treasure truly worth more than your honor...”

[Thorin:] “...I am not my grandfather…”

[The voices suddenly stop, and Thorin looks down and sees the shadowy shape of Smaug sliding beneath the gold {he is imagining things}.]

[Gandalf:] “...this treasure will be your death…”

DIALOG-FLASHBACK - END

[Thorin screams as the gold beneath him turns into a sinkhole and he begins drowning, surrounded by gold. He screams as he tries to escape, but keeps getting pulled down. As he disappears beneath the gold, his imagination/dream ends. He is standing in the golden court. He yanks off his crown and throws it to the floor. He has finally comes back to his senses.]



[Meanwhile, the battle is going badly.]

[Dain:] “FALL BACK! FALL BACK! TO THE BARRICADE! FALL BACK!”

[The remaining dwarves begins retreating toward the gates of Erebor, with the orcs in pursuit.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Now comes their end. Prepare for the final assault.]

[A signal horn sounds, the the orcs regroup to march on the dwarves.]



[Just inside the gates of Erebor, the dwarves of the Company sit desolately, hearing the cries of battle outside but unable to help their kin. They rise as they see Thorin approaching from further in the mountain, sword drawn. He is no longer dressed in his royal robes and arbor, but in a simple leather outfit. Kili rises and begins shouting.]

[Kili:] “I will not hide behind a wall of stone, while others fight our battles for us!”

[Thorin and Kili continue to approach each other.]

[Kili:] “It is not in my blood, Thorin.”

[They stop in front of each other.]

[Thorin:] “No, it is not. We are sons of Durin. And Durin’s folk do not flee from a fight.”

[Thorin lays his hand on Kili’s shoulder, smiling. Kili smiles back at him through his tears. They touch foreheads. Thorin turns to the rest of the dwarves.]

[Thorin:] “I have no right to ask this of any of you; but will you follow me one last time?”

[The dwarves rise and raise their weapons, ready to follow their leader and friend again.]



[Dain and his surviving dwarves set up a desparate shield wall in front of the moat by Erebor’s gates; the orcs line up by rank, ready to attack them. Azog suddenly stops the orcs with him on the hill from signalling the attack.]
 
[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Not yet! Wait...wait]

[Several heavily armored trolls shoulder their way to the front of the Orc ranks.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Attack...now!]

[The orcs sound their signalling horn, and the orcs and trolls begin to march forward. Suddenly, another trumpet is heard; it is Bombur, atop the wall. The orcs stop in confusion. In Dale, Bilbo and Gandalf hear the sound too and look up in surprise.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin!”

[The barricade of rocks in the gateway of Erebor suddenly smashes outward as it is hit from inside by a giant golden statue that the dwarves had hung up like a bell. The rocks fall forward and make a rough bridge across the moat. Thorin and his dwarves rush out and through the ranks of the Iron Hills dwarves; Azog looks on in shock. Dain begins shouting to his troops.]

[Dain:] “TO THE KING! TO THE KING!”

[Thorin:] “Du Bekâr!” [not translated onscreen: To arms!]”

[Thorin leads the way as all the dwarves form a wedge behind him. They smash their way through the orc ranks, releasing their pent up anger and hatred.]

[In Dale, Bilbo and Gandalf look out at the plain from an abandoned causeway.]

[Bilbo:] “The dwarves! They’re rallying!”

[They watch as the dwarves, fighting with new vigour, destroy the orcs.

[Gandalf:] “They are rallying to their king!”



[Bard speaks to his remaining men.]

[Bard:] “Any men who want to give their last - follow me!”

[They charge through the city and clash with the orcs, fighting with reckless abandon now that they know the dwarves are back at it.]



[In the Great Hall, The Woman grabs a spear and speaks to the others huddled inside.]

[The Woman:] “I say we stand with our men in life and in death! Arm yourselves!”

[Many of the women and older men grab their weapons and follow her; Bain grabs his sword. Meanwhile, a woman speaks to an old lady sitting hunched over under her shawl.]

[Woman #2:] “Come with us, love.”

[Alfrid:] “No, no, no! You leave an old woman be.”

[Woman #2:] “Don’t be afraid.”

[The “woman” under the shawl suddenly stops using the fake voice and speaks in a male voice; it is actually Alfrid, who was trying to disguise himself as an old lady.”

[Alfrid:] “I said get off!”

[The Woman reaches over the yanks off the shawl, revealing Alfrid to everyone.]

[The Woman:] “Alfrid Lickspill, you are a coward!”

[Alfrid:] “Coward?! Not every man is brave enough to wear a corsett!”

[Woman #1:] “You’re not a man, you’re a weasel!”

[As the others grab whatever tools or weapons they can find to join the battle, an urn falls over, and Alfrid sees it fall. It breaks open to reveal that is was full of gold and silver coins.]



[On the battlefield, Thorin defeats an orc. He calls out to Dain, who is not far away.]

[Thorin:] “Dain!”

[Dain:] “Thorin!”

[Dain:] “Hold on! I’m coming!”

[They continue killing orcs, all the while getting closer to each other.]

[Dain:] “Hey cousin, what took you so long?!”

[In a brief respite, they are able to meet and hug.]

[Dain:] “There’s too many of these buggars, Thorin. I hope you’ve got a plan.”

[Thorin looks up and sees the hilltop on which Azog’s wooden machines and signalling orders.]

[Thorin:] “Aye - We’re going to take out their leader!”

[Dain:] “Azog...”

[Thorin strides forward and mounts a large goat that Dain’s army had brought.]

[Thorin:] “I’m gonna kill that piece of filth!”

[Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili, each on a goat, charge toward Azog’s hill, smashing through the Orc armies in their way.]

[Dwalin:] “Lead on!”



[Back in Dale, Gandalf watches human spearmen and archers kill a massive troll.]

[Gandalf:] “We may yet survive this.”

[Bilbo:] “GANDALF!”

[Gandalf kills an orc, then hurries over to where Bilbo is standing at the wall and watching Thorin, Dwalin, Fili, and Kili ride up a spur of the mountain to where Azog is.]

[Bilbo:] “It’s Thorin!”

[Gandalf:] “And Fili, Kili...and Dwalin. He’s taking his best warriors!”
 
[Bilbo:] “To do what?”

[Gandalf:] “To cut the head off the snake.”

[Atop the hill, Azog hears the sound of goat hooves, and he snarls. Thorin and Co. reach some ruins on top of the hill, killing orcs along the way; there is a frozen river between them and where Azog is. ]



[Legolas and Tauriel arrive back in Dale together on a horse; they charge through the streets, killing orcs on their way. They come to where Gandalf is standing.]

[Legolas:] “Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “Legolas... Legolas Greenleaf!”

[Legolas:] “There is a second army! Bolg leads a force of Gundabad orcs. They are almost upon us!”

[Gandalf:] “Gundabad…This was their plan all along. Azog engages our forces, then Bolg seeps in from the north.”

[Bilbo:] “Wha...the north...where is the north, exactly?!”

[Gandalf:] “Ravenhill.”

[Gandalf turns and strides over to the parapets to look at the hill where Thorin went; that is Ravenhill.]

[Bilbo:] “Ravenhill…Thorin is up there! And Fili and Kili - they’re all up there!”

[At the sound of Kili’s name, Tauriel is alarmed. Together, they all look out toward the top of Ravenhill, which is shrouded in mist.]



[Thorin and Co. are still fighting in the ruins across the frozen river from Azog’s stronghold. Having defeated all the enemies at present, they look out across the river at the ruins in which Azog was last seen; his wooden signalling machines are visible through the mist.]

[Thorin:] “Where is he?”

[Kili:] “Looks empty. I think Azog has fled!”

[Thorin:] “I don’t think so...Fili, take your brother. Scout out the towers. Keep low and out of sight. If you see something; report back, do not engage - do you understand?!”

[Dwalin:] “We have company; Goblin mercenaries. No more than a hundred.”

[They look back the way they came to see goblins running over the ruins toward them.]

[Thorin:] “We’ll take care of them. Go! Go!”

[Dwalin:] “Come on!”

[As Fili and Kili run towards the river, Thorin and Dwalin prepare to meet the goblins rushing toward them.]



[In a moment of peace, Thranduil walks slowly through the city, seeing the fallen bodies on the ground, many of which are his own elves. His commander comes running up.]

[Thranduil:] “Recall your company.”

[The commander blows a horn. Gandalf comes running up.]

[Gandalf:] “My lord, dispatch this force to Ravenhill! The dwarves are about to be overrun. Thorin must be warned.”

[Thranduil:] “By all means, warn him. I have spent enough Elvish blood in defense of this accursed land - No more!”

[Thranduil walks away haughtily and angrily.]

[Gandalf:] “Thranduil?!”

[Bilbo:] “I’ll go!”

[Gandalf:] “Don’t be ridiculous! You’ll never make it!”

[Bilbo:] “Why not?”

[Gandalf:] “Cause they will see you coming and kill you!”

[Bilbo:] “No, they won’t.”

[Gandalf looks at Bilbo peculiarly.]

[Bilbo:] “They won’t see me.”

[Gandalf:] “It’s out of the question - I won’t allow it!”

[Bilbo:] “I’m not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.”

[Gandalf says nothing; they nod to each other, then Bilbo strides away. Turning a corner, he presses into an alcove and pulls out his ring. He looks at it for a few moments, then puts it on. Invisibly, he runs through the city, seeing the remaining battles. In his ring-enhanced vision, the elves appear to be beings of white light, while the orcs are like solid shadows.]



[As Thranduil and his elves march through the city, killing orcs, they stop abruptly as they see Tauriel standing in the middle of the lane ahead of them, looking resolute.]

[Tauriel:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You will go no further.]

[Tauriel:] “ You will not turn away - not this time!”

[Thranduil:] “Get out of my way!”

[Tauriel:] “The dwarves will be slaughtered!”

[Thranduil:] “Yes, they will die. Today, tomorrow, one year hence, a hundred years from now - what does it matter? They are mortal.”

[Thranduil has slowly been approaching Tauriel as he speaks. Suddenly, Tauriel whips out her bow and nocks an arrow, pointing it at Thranduil.]

[Tauriel:] “You think your life is worth more than theirs, while there is no love in it? There is no love in you!”

[Thranduil looks at her angrily for a moment; suddenly, he whips out his sword and slices Tauriel’s bow in half. As she drops it in shock, Thranduil lifts the point of his sword to her neck and speaks angrily.]

[Thranduil:] “What do you know of love?! Nothing! What you feel for that dwarf is not real! You think it is love?! Are you ready to die for it?”

[Suddenly, another sword, Orcrist, is laid atop Thranduil’s. It is Legolas. He pushes Thranduil’s sword away.]

[Legolas:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: If you harm her, you will have to kill me.]

[As Thranduil stares at him in shock and anger, Thranduil turns to Tauriel.]

[Legolas:] “I will go with you.”

[They hurry away together.]



[Alfrid, still wearing a woman’s outfit and clutching the gold he found to his chest, weaves through the city, dodging orcs. As he backs toward a wall, an orc climbs over it and roars at him. It raises its club to kill him, and he screams. Suddenly, from behind him, Bard shoots and arrow and kills the orc. Alfrid falls over, and money falls out of his dress, and he tries to gather it up]

[Bard:] “Get up!”

[Alfrid:] “Get away from me! I don’t take orders from you! People trusted you. They listened to you. The master’s mantle was there for the taking. And you threw it all away - for what?”

[Bard turns and looks back. Alfrid follows his gaze to see Bard’s children in a doorway, staring at him as his dress is full of coins. He turns and stomps away.]

[Bard:] “Alfrid - your slip is showing.”

[Alfrid adjusts his dress, then rushes away.]



[Invisibly, Bilbo is hurrying across bridges toward Ravenhill.]

[Fili and Kili creep quietly through the ruins below Azog’s signalling station. They hear a noise.]
 
[Fili:] “Stay here. Search the lower levels. I’ve got this.”



[Having defeated the goblins, Thorin looks anxiously out over the frozen river.]

[Dwalin:] “Where is that orc filth?”

[Bilbo appears out of thin air behind him, panting.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin…”

[Thorin:] “Bilbo!”

[Bilbo:] “You have to leave here! Now! Azog has another army attacking from the north. This watchtower will be completely surrounded. There’ll be no way out.”

[Dwalin:] “We are so close! That orc scum is in there. I say we push on.”

[Thorin:] “No! That’s what he wants. He wants to draw us in.”

[Suddenly, Thorin appears to have understood something alarming.]

[Thorin:] “This is a trap!”



[In the ruins, Fili hears a sound in front of him and turns around, only to see lights coming up the hallway from behind him too; he is trapped.]



[Thorin talks to Dwalin.]

[Thorin:] “Find Fili and Kili! Call them back!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin, are you sure about this?”

[Thorin:] “Do it. We live to fight another day.”

[As they turn to leave, they hear a drum sound from Ravenhill. Looking back at the tower, they see a light appear. Atop the tower, Azog appears, dragging a bloodied Fili behind him.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: This one dies first.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Then the brother.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Then you, Oakenshield.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: You will die last.]

[Fili:] “No! RUN!”

[Thorin, Dwalin, and Bilbo look on in shock as Azog lifts Fili by the neck, then stabs him through the chest with his arm-blade.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Here ends your filthy bloodline!]

[Azog drops Fili, who falls to the ground from the tower, lifeless. He falls past Kili, who has been watching from a doorway below. Kili, seeing his dead brother on the ground, furiously rushes up the tower steps toward Azog.]

[Thorin:] “KILI!”

[Thorin begins running across the frozen river.]

[Dwalin:] “Thorin!”

[Dwalin:] “Thorin...No.”

[Kili rushes up the steps, killing orcs in his way. As Thorin begins to clamber up the ruins, Azog rushes out of a tunnel and attacks him. They fight on the snowy mountainside, Thorin with his sword and Azog with his arm-blade and a mace.]

[Bilbo, still on the other side of the river, hears a noise and ducks as werebats fly out of the fog. His sword glows blue, and he looks back to see Bolg and his forces climbing over the ruins. Seeing Bilbo, the orcs charge at him. Just before they reach him, Dwalin charges up and begins fighting the orcs singlehandedly.]

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” 

[Bolg:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Slay them all!]

[Tauriel and Legolas pause on their way to Ravenhill as they see the Werebats massing.]

[Tauriel:] “No…”

[The werebats fly down to the main battlefields, swooping through ranks of soldiers and causing mayhem. Legolas leaps and grabs the leg of a passing Werebat, and it carries him away. Tauriel sees Kili fighting several orcs on the ruins.]

[Tauriel:] “Kili...”

[Azog and Thorin continue fighting. Thorin manages to knock Azog down, and Azog slides down a slippery slope; before Thorin can chase after him, other orcs arrive and he is forced to fight them. In the courtyard, Bilbo throws rocks at orcs as Dwalin fights. Kili continue fighting his way up the ruins. Tauriel, looking for him, encounters and kills several orcs. Meanwhile, the werebat is still carrying Legolas in the air.]

[As Bilbo continues throwing rocks, Bolg suddenly runs out and smacks Bilbo in the head with the handle of his mace, knocking him out cold. As the werebat carries Legolas over a stone tower, he shoots it through the neck, killing it and forcing it to release him; he drops gracefully on top of the tower. Azog, recovered suddenly charges at Thorin and knocks him onto the surface of the frozen river.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Go in for the kill!]

[Azog yells to his orcs, many of which run out on to the ice to attack Thorin.]

[Azog:] “_ _ _” [Subtitle: Finish him!]

[Thorin looks around rapidly as many orcs run toward him; suddenly, the orcs begin falling over with arrows stuck in them. Legolas is shooting the orcs attacking Thorin from the top of the tower. Thorin, with his broken sword, takes on the remaining orcs.]

[Tauriel, in a moment of peace after dispatching her opponent, calls out.]

[Tauriel:] “KILI!”

[Kili hears her, but he’s too busy fighting two orcs at once to respond.] 

[Tauriel:] “KILI!”

[Kili:] “TAURIEL!”

[Tauriel:] “Kili…”

[Suddenly, Bolg jumps out of a tunnel and kicks Tauriel into a rock.]

[Tauriel:] “NO!”

[Seeing this, Kili angrily defeats his opponents and begins making his way toward her. Tauriel manages to slip out from Bolg’s grasp and begins attacking him with her knife; he manages to grab both her arms and twists them, causing her to shriek in pain; he then smashes his fist down on her head, felling her. Thorin continues fighting orcs while Legolas helps. Kili rushes desperately as he hears Tauriel’s groans. Bolg raises Tauriel up by the throat; she manages to kick him in the knee, causing him to fall. He grabs her and throws her bodily against a wall. As she lays stunned on the ground, he raises his mace for the kill; suddenly, Kili leaps from a parapet onto him. They fight, and Kili manages to slash him, but Bolg grabs Kili by the head and raises the pointed base of his mace to stab him through the chest. Tauriel shout and jumps on Bolg from behind.]

[Tauriel:] “No!”

[Bolg manages to throw her down again, and she can do nothing as Bolg raises his mace and plunges it through Kili’s chest.]

[Tauriel:] “No!”

[As Kili dies, he and Tauriel stare into each others eyes; both of them are tearing up. Bolg drops Kili to the ground dead. Tauriel’s grief turns to anger, and she leaps onto Bolg as he approaches her. They are standing over the edge of a precipice, and Bolg tries to swing her out over the fall. She manages to hold on to him and kick off a stone, launching them both over the edge.]

[Legolas, on top of the tower, suddenly feels the tower shaking. He looks down to see a troll smashing away at the tower’s base. Hearing Tauriel’s grunts, he looks out and sees her rolling with Bolg down the mountainside. She lands on a broken staircase, gasping in pain. Meanwhile, Bolg has landed near her; he rises and prepares to kill her. Legolas, seeing this, reaches back for an arrow, only to find that he has run out. He angrily throws down his bow and pulls out Orcrist. He leaps off the top of the tower and plummets down holding his sword out; he manages to stab the troll in the head, and it hobbles around in pain. Twisting the sword, he manages to get the troll to charge forward, smashing head first into the already-weakened base of the tower. Bolg looks up to see the tower fall over and make a bridge over the chasm in between Legolas and Bolg. As Tauriel lays unconscious, Bolg and Legolas charge at each other over the makeshift bridge. They begin fighting. As they fight, Bolg swings his heavy mace at Legolas and misses, hitting the floor and causing it to crumble and fall into the chasm.]

[Meanwhile, Thorin manages to stab an orc in the knee; another orc rushes up and smashes into him, causing him to slide across the ice all the way to the edge of the waterfall, directly over Legolas and Bolg. Bolg knocks Legolas over, but as he raises his mace, Thorin manages to knock an orc over the edge of the waterfall; it lands on the bridge behind Bolg, breaking through the stones and causing him to fall under a pile of rubble. Another orc approaches Thorin, who is lying on his back, partially hanging over the edge of the waterfall, defenseless. As it raises its sword, Legolas manages to throw Orcrist into the orc’s chest, killing it. As it falls over the edge, Thorin manages to reach out and grab the sword, saving it from going over.]

[As Legolas is watching Thorin, Bolg leaps out of the rubble and swings at Legolas, but Legolas dodges and pulls out his two knives, fighting Bolg with them. Thorin stands and looks in wonder at his blade come back to him; he looks up and sees Azog, alone, facing him. Thorin and Azog approach each other slowly; suddenly, a horn blows, and Azog smiles as a hill in the distance behind him becomes covered with approaching orc help. Azog charges forward and swings a large rock attached to a chain at Thorin, who ducks under it. As Azog is unbalanced by the swing, Thorin manages to get behind him and slash him. Azog angrily swings the rock at him again, and as Thorin dodges, the rock smashes into the ice, cracking it.]

[Meanwhile, Bolg throws a huge stone at Legolas, and it smashes the bridge beneath him. In an amazing and inhuman feat of agility, Legolas manages to run up falling rocks and leaps at Bolg. As they fight, Legolas manages to stab at Bolg, but Bolg grabs the knife between his arm and armor, just like in their encounter in Laketown. This time, though, Legolas smiles and uses the knife as leverage to swing atop Bolg’s shoulder; he then stabs Bolg through the top of the head, killing him; Legolas leaps back onto land as the bridge falls to the ground, carrying Bolg’s body with it. Legolas looks for Tauriel, but doesn’t see her.] 

[Legolas:] “Tauriel!”

[As Thorin and Azog fight, the ice continues cracking. They both pause for a second, then Azog swings again. This time, the ice actually begins to break apart beneath them. As Thorin stumbles over an edge of the ice, Azog manages to knock his legs out from under him with the chain. As Azog swings again, Thorin manages to roll away. He leaps behind Azog, who is off balance, and slashes him again. Azog angrily swings the rock and chain at Thorin, missing; this time, the rock becomes stuck in the ice, and Azog is forced to slash at Thorin with his bladed arm. Suddenly, Azog looks into the sky behind Thorin in shock; we see the Eagles, with Radagast riding their leader, swoop by. They sail through the ranks of the oncoming orc reinforcements from Gundabad, decimating them. Beorn, riding atop one of the Eagles, throws himself off it and transforms into a bear as he falls to the ground, landing in full massive bear form right in the middle of the orcs. He smashes through them.]

[Meanwhile, Thorin suddenly throws his sword down. Reaching forward, he lifts the rock at the end of the chain and tosses it to Azog, who instinctively catches it. Azog looks at him in shock. Thorin jumps backward, off the ice floe that they were both standing on; without his weight to balance it, and with Azog at the other end holding the rock, the ice floe tips over and plunges Azog into the water below. He scrabbles at the edge, but the chain pulls him down. Thorin pants in exhaustion.]

[The Eagles attack the werebats, ripping them out of the air. As Thorin bends down to pick up Orcrist, he sees Azog through the ice, being pulled slowly by the current toward the frozen waterfall. Thorin slowly walks above him, and they stare at each other through the ice. Azog closes his eyes. Suddenly, he opens them, and he manages to stab Thorin through the foot, through the ice, with his blade arm. He leaps through the ice and pins Thorin down. As he stabs his blade arm at Thorin, Thorin manages to stop it from piercing his chest by sliding Orcrist in one of the forks of the blade. Azog, using gravity and his superior weight and position, slowly pushes his blade further and further, and Thorin struggles to keep it away. As they stare at each other, Thorin suddenly slides his sword out of the fork, allowing Azog’s blade to stab him through the chest. As Azog smiles, Thorin raises his own sword and stabs Azog through the heart; from their close quarters, Azog cannot avoid it. Thorin flips Azog over onto his back on the ice and forces Orcrist all the way through Azog and through the ice below. Azog dies, with Thorin kneeling on top of him. Thorin, mortally wounded, struggles to get up.]

[Bilbo, waking up from unconsciousness, sees the Eagles overhead.]

[Bilbo:] “The eagles are coming…”

[Thorin stumbles toward the edge of the frozen waterfall, looking out over the battlefield below, where the remaining orcs are being routed. Weak from his wound, he collapses on his back. Bilbo comes running up in surprise.]

[Thorin:] “Bilbo…”

[Bilbo:] “Don’t move! Don’t move! Lie still!

[Bilbo examines Thorin’s wound, then recoils in shock.]

[Bilbo:] “Oh!

[Thorin:] “I’m glad you’re here…

[Bilbo:] “Shh.”

[Thorin:] “I wish to part from you in friendship.”

[Bilbo:] “No. You are not going anywhere, Thorin. You’re going to live.”

[Thorin:] “I would take back my words and my deeds at the gate. You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me...I was too  blind to see. I’m so sorry that I have led you into such peril.”

[Thorin begins choking up blood.]

[Bilbo:] “No, no, I’m glad to have shared in all your perils,Thorin - each and every one of them. And it’s far more than any Baggins deserve.”

[They smile at each other.]

[Thorin:] “Farewell, Master Burglar. Go back to your books and your armchair. Plant your trees - watch them grow.”

[Thorin struggles to choke.]

[Thorin:] “If more people valued home above gold this world would be a merrier place.”

[Thorin gasps deeply, then begins to expire.]

[Bilbo:] “No! No! No! No! No! No! Thorin! Oh don’t you dare!”

[Thorin breathes out his last and dies.]

[Bilbo:] “Thorin, Thorin, wake up. The eagles...the eagles...the eagles are here. Thorin...the eag…”

[Bilbo cries in sorrow.]



[Tauriel, heartbroken, places Kili’s stone in his dead hand, as Legolas watches.]



[Thranduil walks slowly through the ruins of Ravenhill, gazing about at the carnage. Legolas approaches him.]

[Legolas:] “I...cannot go back.”

[Legolas brushes past his father and prepares to leave.]

[Thranduil:] “Where will you go?”

[Legolas turns and faces Thranduil.] 

[Legolas:] “I do not know.”

[Thranduil:] “Go north. Find the Dúnedain. There’s a young Ranger amongst them- you should meet him. His father, Arathorn, was a good man. His son might grow to be a great one.”

[Legolas:] “What is his name?”

[Thranduil:] “He’s known in the wild as Strider. His true name you must discover for yourself.”

[They nod at each other, then Legolas turns and walks away. Thranduil calls after him, and Legolas pauses.]

[Thranduil:] “Legolas... your mother loved you...more than anyone...more than life.”

[Legolas opens his eyes open in shock and surprise. Legolas and Thranduil make a gesture of departure to each other, then Legolas leaves. Thranduil watches him leave sadly, bowing his head in grief. He then proceeds through the ruins and finds Tauriel still next to Kili’s body.]

[Tauriel:] “They want to bury him.”

[Thranduil:] “Yes…”

[Tauriel:] “If this is love, I do not want it.”

[Heartbrokenly, Tauriel pleads with Thranduil.]

[Tauriel:] “Take it from me, please! Why does it hurt so much?”

[Thranduil approaches her slowly with an understanding look in his eyes.]

[Thranduil:] “Because it was real.”

[Tauriel looks up at him in shock. After thinking for a while, she kisses Kili one last time.]



[Bilbo is sitting by himself and staring off into the distance; Gandalf comes to join him. They sit there, quietly, thinking. Gandalf begins cleaning out his pipe quite noisily, and Bilbo looks like he’s about to object. After a moment’s pause, they nod at each other.]

[The remaining members of Thorin’s company kneel beside the body of their King, paying him homage. Bilbo and Gandalf, sitting, watch.]

[In Dale, Percy blows on a huge horn, and all the townspeople, who are gathered along the walls, stare out reverently at Erebor; this is presumably during Thorin’s funeral.]



[Bilbo and Balin walk out of the gates of Erebor; Bilbo is wearing his pack and is prepared to leave. Balin tries to persuade him to stay.]

[Balin:] “There is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be song, tales will be told and Thorin Oakenshield will pass into legend.”

[Bilbo:] “I know that’s how you must honor him, but to me he was never that - he was...to me...he was…”

[Bilbo is unable to find the words, and Balin smiles fondly at him.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, I think I’ll slip quietly away. Will you tell we others I said goodbye?”

[Balin:] “You can tell’ em yourself.”

[Bilbo looks back and smiles as he sees the other dwarves standing behind him. He speaks to all of them.]

[Bilbo:] “If any of you ever passing Bag End, tea is at four - there’s plenty of it. You are welcome anytime.”

[The dwarves bow to him, and he smiles. He begins to turn away, then turns back.]

[Bilbo:] “Eh, don’t bother knocking.”

[The dwarves chuckle, some of them wiping away tears. Bilbo, after waving goodbye, walks toward Gandalf, who is waiting with his horse and a pony for Bilbo.]

[They ride slowly back toward the Shire, admiring the scenery as they go.]



[They dismount at the edge of the Shire, and Bilbo begins to walk with all his things in his arms.]

[Gandalf:] “Ah, the borders of the Shire. It is here I must leave you.”

[Bilbo:] “That’s a shame. I quite liked having a wizard around. Seems they bring good luck.”

[Gandalf:] “You don’t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck?”

[Gandalf looks knowingly at Bilbo.]

[Gandalf:] “Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo.”

[Bilbo begins to protest, but Gandalf interrupts him.]

[Gandalf:] “Don’t take me for a fool - I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels...and I’ve kept my eye on you ever since.”

[Now that the secret is out, Bilbo smiles.]

[Bilbo:] “Well, thank goodness.”

[Bilbo:] “Farewell, Gandalf.”

[They clasp hands and look each other in the eye.]

[Gandalf:] “Farewell.”

[Bilbo turns and walks away; after a few paces, he stops and turns.]

[Bilbo:] “You, uh...you needn’t worry about that ring. It fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it.”

[Gandalf:] “You’re a very fine person, Mister Baggins. And I’m very fond of you. But you’re only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all.” 

[Bilbo continues walking back to the Shire, and Gandalf goes back the way he came.]



[As Bilbo climbs over the last hill before Hobbiton, he sees a lot of activity near Bag End, across the valley. As he walks up the path toward his house, he sees many hobbits passing in the opposite direction as him carrying various articles of furniture and other household articles.]
 
[Bilbo:] “Wait a minute...that’s my mother’s glory box. And that’s...my dining chair.”

[He sees a hobbit carrying a pouf (ottoman) on his shoulder.]

[Bilbo:] “Ah! Put that pouf down! What is going on?!”

[A hobbit with a wheelbarrow full of things stops to greet him cheerfully.]

[Hobbit:] “Hello, Mister Bilbo!” 

[Suddenly, he realizes who he is talking to and looks surprised.]

[Hobbit:] “...You’re not supposed to be here.”

[Bilbo:] “What do you mean?”

[Hobbit:] “On account of you being presumed dead and all.”

[Bilbo:] “I am not dead! Presumed or otherwise!”

[Bilbo turns and hurries up the hill toward Bag End, passing more and more hobbits carrying his things.]

[Hobbit:] “I’m not sure that’s permitted, Mister Bilbo!”

[In front of Bag End, and auctioneer is auctioning off Bilbo’s things. A sign reads: “For sale, by auction. The effects and estate of the late Mr. Bilbo Baggins, esq. 10 o’clock sharp, June the 22nd. Messrs Grubb, Grubb and Burrowes. Registered Auctioneers.]

[Auctioneer:]  “Twenty-one! Haha! Sold to Mrs Bolger! Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on, haha!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Do I have any bids for this? This is Shire-made. None of your dwarvish reproductions here.”

[Auctioneer:] “Our next bid…”

[Bilbo, running up, interrupts him.]

[Bilbo:] “Stop! Stop! There’s been a mistake!”

[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins:] “Who are you?”  

[Bilbo:] “What do you mean who am I?! - You know bloody well who I am, Lobelia Sackville-Baggins! This is my home! And those are my spoons. Thank you very much!”

[Bilbo takes back some spoons that Lobelia had just bought at the auction.]

[Auctioneer:]  “This is most irregular. Excuse me, it’s been more than thirteen months since the disappearance. If you are, in fact, Bilbo Baggins and undeceased - can you prove it?”

[Bilbo:] “What?!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Oh, well, something official with your name on it would suffice.”

[Bilbo is, justifiably, quite flustered.]

[Bilbo:] “Alright! Right.”

[He pulls out the contract that he’d signed to join Thorin’s company and looks through it.]

[Bilbo:] “A contract...of employment as a...a...nevermind as what.”

[He shows it to the auctioneer.]

[Bilbo:] “There! My signature!”

[Auctioneer:]  “Uh, certainly seems to be in order. Yes, seems there can be no doubt.”

[As the auctioneer is reading, Bilbo mounts the steps to his house.]

[Auctioneer:]  “Who is this person you pledged your service to?”

[Bilbo pauses at the door.]

[Auctioneer:]  “...Thorin Oakenshield.”

[Bilbo looks sad.]

[Bilbo:] “He- he was my friend.”

[Opening the door, Bilbo walks in to find his house a mess, with items strewn all across the floor. As he walks about, he finds a handkerchief with his initials, BB, on it. He looks up and smiles. Finding a picture of his mother on the floor, he puts it back up on the wall next to the picture of his father; he straightens it out. He steps back and looks at it. As he inspects his handiwork, he puts his hands in his waistcoat pocket, but then pulls them out quickly when he feels his ring. He hesitates to put his hand back in his pocket, going back and forth. Eventually, he pulls it out and looks at it.]



[We see the hand holding the ring; it is now much older. We see that it is the present time, and Bilbo is quite old. A knock sounds at the door, and Bilbo clutches the ring tightly. He yells out.]

[Bilbo:] “No, thank you! We don’t want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!”

[The voice of Gandalf is heard from outside.]

[Gandalf:] “And what about very old friends?!”

[Bilbo smiles broadly and hurries to open the door. We hear him and Gandalf talking in the background as the camera pans to one of Bilbo’s maps of Middle Earth, eventually centering on the Lonely Mountain.]

[Bilbo:] “Gandalf?!”

[Gandalf:] “Bilbo Baggins.”

[Bilbo:] “My dear Gandalf!”

[Gandalf:] “Good to see you. One hundred eleven years old - who’d believe it?" 

[Bilbo:] “Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome!”
